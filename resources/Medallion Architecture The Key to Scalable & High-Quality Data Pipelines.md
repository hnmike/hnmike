> Medallion Architecture: The Key to Scalable & High-Quality Data Pipelines  
Medallion Architecture also known as Multi-Hop Architecture is a structured approach that improves data quality in stages, making it easier to manage, govern, and scale.  
Think of it as three layers of data refinement:  
1- Bronze Layer (Raw Data)  
\-> Stores unprocessed data straight from the source.  
\-> Keeps historical records for audits, CDC, and lineage tracking.  
\-> Acts as a backupâ€”so you can always reprocess data if needed.  
2- Silver Layer (Validated Data)  
\-> Cleans, validates, and applies schema enforcement.  
\-> Handles deduplication, missing values, and data consistency.  
\-> Powers self-service analytics, reporting, and machine learning.  
3- Gold Layer (Optimized Data)  
\-> Aggregated and transformed for business insights.  
\-> Read-optimized for dashboards and executive reports.  
\-> Denormalized to reduce query complexity and boost performance.  
  
Why Medallion Architecture?  
\->Ensures data quality improves at each step.  
\-> Reduces processing overhead for BI tools.  
\-> Keeps raw data intact for easy reprocessing.  
\-> Supports both structured and semi-structured data.  
  
Challenges to Consider:  
\-> Increased storage costs across multiple layers.  
\-> Potential data latency due to multi-stage processing.  
\-> Requires strong governance to prevent redundancy.  
  
At the end of the day, Medallion Architecture is a game-changer for building scalable, reliable, and efficient data pipelines.
