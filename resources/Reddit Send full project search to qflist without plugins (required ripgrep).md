> 
> 1. you can set `grepprg` to whatever you want. By default it's `grep` but neovim sets it to `ripgrep` if installed.
> 2. you can omit \*\* if you use `ripgrep` and for `grep` i recommend to changing `grepprg` to add the -R flag (among the other ones).
> 3. just so you know `cwindow` exists, which opens the quickfix only if there are valid entries. This is immensely useful when combined with `:make`
> 
> To wrap it up, you can automatically open the quickfix window after a grep search with this simple autocommand:
> 
> autocmd QuickFixCmdPost grep cwindow

> > 2. You're right, I was looking at the vimgrep command for that. Removed. Am I missing something on the -R flag though? I can't find that flag in a search of rg's man page
> > 3. Didn't know about this command. Thanks! Great idea on the autocmd as well

All I know was it was not respecting the default `--ignore-vcs` option in `rg` when run with `**`, and I assume that was why.
