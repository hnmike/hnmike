> for for just putting the light on cuz it's a bit dark I look a bit dark hello everyone so today I'm going to be doing the dimension dimensional data modeling homework and from what I understand I don't need to do free for this it's just lab one and lab two um and and yeah uh I think I know what I need to do so we'll see if I get stuck and if I get stuck hopefully there are some people watching who can help but um yeah I I'm pretty sure I only need La one on La two I'm not going to do lab three until like Sunday I don't think or maybe Monday just because I weekends are spent like with the kids and like tonight is spent with the kids so I've probably got about another 40 minutes before um I need to leave so hopefully I get it all done in that time but yeah uh I'm going to get started and yeah so from I've had a quick read of this and it seems quite similar like the instructions that we need to do it feels very similar to the labs so I shouldn't hopefully have an issue with it um um but yeah we'll see so basically there is a actress film like data set and we need to make some changes to that data set so we've got public actor films um and then in there we've got actor actor ID film ID we've got year votes rating and film ID so the actor ID and the film ID are a primary key and we've got um a few different fields that we we care about so we've got year we've got vs we've got rating and and the the name of the film um and so the first thing that they want us to do Zach wants us to do is he wants us to create an actress table um and he's provided a um like a instructions for that and the actors table needs to contain the following things so it's um we need to create a structure um film with the following Fields so film vote rating and film ID so similarly to in the lab where we create the what was the data structure it was um let me have a look at that similar to the season stats data structure that we created in the lab and then we want a quality class which has star good average and bad which is I assume like creating the enum again so we create an enum for that and then um similarly to what we do in the scoring class in the um in in the lab and then we have an exactive similarly to what we had in the um lab as well so th those are the three things that we need to create for for the first table um so I think based on that I think we can go ahead and do that um so I'm going to keep I'm actually going to keep this here but I'm just going to comment out I I don't need to um continue this is why so let's create the the the structure which is going to be films and just going to is is my volume low thank you for the update let me see if I can turn that up and if that makes any any better it's interesting because I have the exact same settings as I had last time and I thought that that's what people like like what what people wanted but it might just be a bit low this time maybe um 15 so I've turned it up a little bit is that better if not I can I can try and move it closer hello is that better I will continue say on for now I don't want to increase it anymore until someone's giving me feedback okay great that's great to hear okay so I'm going to create my um structure and just make sure that like the like the structure is got the things that that Zach has has asked for so create type um films and then in there as and I'm just going to have a look at the columns here so film is T V I assume is integer rating a is going to be real but I'll check and film ID I don't know what that is so let me just check there all my do is text so I'm just going to check rating is real and votes is inj yet that's correct so that is the type that we need to create for that um and that has been successfully created cool and so I'm just going to comment that out now so I'm going to try and keep like this all hi hi hi Manas is that how I pronounce it Manas um I'm I always like really really worry about pronouncing people's names because I just like I get to the point I get really nervous about PR mispronouncing someone's name and by getting so nervous that I'm mispronouncing someone name I end up mispronouncing someone someone's name and then creating a enum type as well so I'm interested to see like how like Co pilot is going to mark this do you know you can think like like people are going to cheat from my homework but ultimately um they're only cheating themselves if they do because because then they're not going to learn the concepts whereas if if you try and do it yourself and maybe using stuff as a reference is fine but like but if if they're going to just take what I've done there's there's nothing stopping someone just finding someone's solution and just on GitHub and then and then taking it and submitting it but they're not going to actually like digest the information and they're not going to actually learn from it so um if that's what they want to do then fine but they're only going to cheat themselves and not actually learn the course content that's my opinion anyway I mean um I think yeah I don't know that's but I I I honestly don't think they need to either because it is very very similar from what I can see to the to the L okay so now we can create our table and then we the table is called Phil what's the table called actors and then inside of that we want to have a films films and then we want to have a quality class and we want to have an is active which is a boo think that is right I should remember to put um that at the end of everything as well because I don't know um co-pilot's going to like try and is is going to mark that down so we'll see okay so this I'm pretty sure he's done so number one complete and then I'll just have a little um one and then I will do two um cumulative table generation query so I don't know if anyone's watching and they've already done this like then one of the things I was wondering was in the lab um Zach does this thing where he um has like this generate series which basically like you can put a start like year and an end year of like doing the generation and I was wondering do you think did you just put for one specific year or did you do that like series Generation Um I was just wondering whether or not I should do the generate Series so that you can popular it a couple of years or just do the one year let me know okay so so this is where it gets like um where we end up having to to do a big ass query usually from what from what I um from from what I remember which was um basically we do a okay let's populate this particular year and and generate the like current current data from the data before so so we do with so we need to compare the year from previous and the year now are like the next year um so so if they were say say we're checking whether or not it's 2007 we need to we need to check whether or not in 2007 that actor is is clusters um active or not so I assum that the query that we need to do basically means that we we need to to specify for every year that we do whether or not for the current year that they're classified as active um and so so like just said the current year they want to check in the year 2008 is this actor active yes or no um and if they aren't then then like it'll be false and if they are then it'll be true and then in in 2009 you then compare okay well in 2007 they weren't active but they're now active in 200 2008 so now in for the year 2008 they are active I'm pretty sure that's what we need to do so the first thing I think we need to do is do with GE um yeah as and then the select statement that we need to do is we going to select from um the the current season um well the current year um so let's act to films so just see we we pick the C use 2024 for for right okay so going to do select I'm going to start with the basic query of selecting the the data and moving it into the format that I want I want to move it in for so I'm just having a look and what I don't understand is how does the ACT his table um know which actor is going to be there so for example there's no field that H for the actor um does it need the actor's field in there I think it needs the actor's actor Ide at least um okay that's fine I need to drop the O table for rating f i do um okay they're fine um so I will add the actor and the ACT ID in in there one thing that really triggers me is that some things have like underscore on them and then some like fil ideas doesn't have between it well that's just a pcel thing I don't know why I'm B by that that's fine okay so I've just added the actor and the actor ID in there um everything else kind of goes in here I'm pretty sure film The no we need the year as well actually yeah and that is going to be an integer that's fine and then now we've got that we can then do a select while we select the things that we need to based on the cases that we've got for e sorry I know I'm being quiet I'm just thinking about the the the right way to write this um cuz you have to do like a case type thing where you do okay um create a a structure for for I think I think it's some sort of like case right here so we do case when um when just GOOG that's not what I need to do I need to get and then I need to go and do and then do that as um the quality the fils and then do \[Music\] a is active then your case I know this isn't going to be the final thing I'm just getting down my faults right now of what it needs to be for for the quality class okay so I'm doing an act to act yeah like creating a struct and then I am setting the rating based on the thingy um and I'm just going to do it for one year for now where equals was a good year for okay so that gets the information on What actors were active this year but it doesn't give the information on the actors who weren't active this year so we need to then do a check on on What actors haven't made a film this year as well as ones that have um as well as that does do we need to so do need to like in in the lab we needed to add on like the films for each of the years so um well each of the seasons for for for the year so like and like you would have the season for the previous year um and then for when you're looking at the current year you would see the current year so do we want to see the list of all the films the actors has had up until the current year and and then like yes I think that's what we want to do isn't it that's what we want to do we want to have okay well just say an actor started in 2000 and they have um been the the first film was in 2000 then they did another film in 2002 and then now we have a collection of all the films they've been in from like previously so a bit like I DB where you kind of get all the list of films and then um you get um the yeah okay that makes sense that's fine that makes that makes sense I can do that cool so what I'm just going to do is I'm going to drop this table again I'm just going to create I'm going to call this current year instead of year just so it's less confusing and then I'm going to do that that's fine okay I can do that for e so if I do a select um and Min year as first year and then I do a from name I keep keep thinking I'm doing the old la is that okay F so that gets the list of actors um for for basically what the f season was and then we want to compare the current season that we've got against the season that that we want to compare the current year that we've got versus the first year to make sure that it's after the first year or it's the same as the first year that they started do being an actor so we can that that should be fine so yeah I'm just going to do um the CTA that was done in the lab which basically said with um years uh with years as so just from I'm just going to do a hardcode year 2002 as yeah and then I'm going to do a and then I'm going to do this which was um what would be a good name for this um and I'll just s um basically this thing in here and then I going to do a select star from that's his first year and then join the years just first year here equal less or equal to the cor here okay I just do that generate hi hi Greg how you doing I'm just GNA do this yeah that's right why okay this is fine so we have the actors first here and we have the ACT current year okay so we can call that so now saying that we we only getting the think the PE the actors who have we're only getting the actors for the years where they the first year was before now or before the current selected year and then we are going to do another select statement so many sex statements um you end up with like a massive query here don't you you just end up with so many things and this is where I want to do this here actually for second what do you find interesting about my thinking process what was it um no I'm trying to get everything I'm I'm trying to only get actors at the moment from um that are above the like from when they first started to to now so I'm not getting any actors who say the current year is 2002 um but you've got some actors in the database that are 200 10 I'm I'm only getting the actors from um who who have actually done stuff before then um so if the actes aren't there then it should return um it should return like a null for that and you should be able to say that they're not active okay so we need to actually aggregate this data here so if we're going to aggregate this data we need to like when we do the left we'll do the left join first which is we're going to left join with um the like act's table um so so we're going to left join we've got the actor actor actors um I should probably change that shouldn't I for I'm going to add actor ID in there cuz we need the actor ID menu is first year fine that's fine um cool so we can do act ID and then we can do a left join to then say okay we're going to get the the which is here and then we're going to basically left join on actor ID and then we're going to say and on the year equaling the current year yeah but we need to do some coalescing here as well so we need to we need to actually when we do the aggregating here we need to do the coalescing from the actual so that's fine okay for thr in here I can end that we partition the data by the the actor ID we just going to order by current year because the current year is the latest if we're doing if we're doing it cumulatively I'm going to do uh I whenever I think of AF I think as f c yes they are asking if the ACT is still active so um well I'm not not sure it's currently active so there might not be I don't think I don't think that's necessarily true because someone could be an actor in 1999 but they might not have been active in 2000 but they're still not active like in 2000 yeah Chang all that nowy for what light okay that's fine for okay yeah that's fine I've just not updated it to use the um AF AF and then actors films but okay I'm not getting any data in here that's fine I think for Hi Ian how you doing yeah I'm just writing my ESC query at the moment I think that is working as I want it to but I still need to um create the I still need to C do the isactive um flag um I also don't think that I can we waiting so I'm going to have to stop there because I need to go do some stuff but the things that I need to do next is I need to \[Music\] um I need to I don't think this is calculating the like average of all the ratings for the current year so I need to figure out how to do that make sure that it's doing it correctly um cuz I think it will not be doing that at the moment um cuz you can see here like I've also got the duplicates for these two people so I think it's just selecting twice so um yeah so when they've got multiple so I need to remove the duplicates here I need to um need to remove the duplicate one remove dup dcat to verify the rating is right is take how how is right I don't think that's right right now um cuz you could have multiple you could have multiple ratings for one year and so you need to take the like Collective average for that year but not for the previous years um so so that's something that that we'll need to do um and then as well as that uh we still need to do the isactive flag so we need to do um is the person currently active and then I think that isn't then we just need to insert the data once we've done those things so remove UL verify the rating is right um add the active at the moment because it's not doing that and insert the data they add a few things that we need to do I don't think I'm going to check actually a second yeah no you can see that the the rating isn't right because it's just doing the rating for each one so it's going average uh and then it'll be bad which because that's a 3.8 that's a 4.4 and that's a 7.4 so yeah we need to correct that and then yeah yeah but I'll have to do that later just cuz I need to go and see my Kos yeah sorry I know I just said that I said I had to go um but um yeah that's \[Music\] fine bye for
