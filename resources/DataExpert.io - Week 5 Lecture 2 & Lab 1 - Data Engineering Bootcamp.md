> e e e e e e to the end of the day one if you're taking this class for credit make sure to switch over to the other tab you can get credit for the day two lecture leading and lagging metrics um ultimately almost every metric that you write should be correlated in some way with money and the metric might even be money revenue is its own metric um one of the problems with Revenue as a metric is that it could be kind of slow moving and it's uh and there's a lot of things that have to happen before Revenue happens and so generally speaking revenue is going to be uh what I would call a lagging metric whereas there's going to be a lot of other leading metric right so in this case as data Engineers the data that we provide should be linked to money either in increasing revenue or decreasing cost so maybe we're optimizing a job and uh and so that's like we're we're it's very meta when you're optimizing pipelines it's a very meta way of doing it because like your the data about the data that you're creating is saving money right it's very like meta but maybe you're supplying data that makes customer service more efficient and then that makes their process faster and their thing better so that's what I'm saying in that case it's like you're supplying data that cuts costs in other areas of the business but that's not to say that data engineering itself doesn't have costs so you can do it that way too optimizing pipelines optimizing business processes uh reducing cost and you can also have it be on the other side where you can increase Revenue where uh you maybe you have new data sets that uh provide new additional context thank you for that sorry about that I just realized um my mic wasn't wasn't the audio wasn't working what what I was saying was uh I'm going to be doing the lecture two um day day two lecture first and then we'll be moving on to the lab one uh yeah sorry about that um it's been a day it's been one of those days it's been a really crap day to be honest I've not enjoyed today uh yeah it's not been a day it's not been a good day that allow people to take more risks or to have a better understanding of the competitive environment so that they can or lower prices to get more volume or more uh margin and so there's all sorts of these metrics in the business area that are going to be linked to money I think there is like one uh exception here obviously the one exception I think is uh where your how's your day been have you have you done anything good anything bad um yeah it's I just felt really really like me today really me that's the only way I can describe it like um I I think um kly Taylor posted some on on LinkedIn the other day saying how it's you know two weeks into January and she's already feeling so effing burned out and that's how I feel like and um yeah working in like a nonprofit but it's hard because because this isn't what's making me feel yeah hasn't stopped about since about November completely like like for me it's it's it's all to do with work like everything everything online like do what I'm doing here what I do the content creation that's the stuff that gives me energy but then then when I get to work I just feel so drained if you're like a like working in like a charity or a nonprofit then maybe your uh North Star metric is different where it might be lives saved or people helped or children educated or Garbage taken out of the ocean but even then uh even nonprofits still care about the other side though they still care about spend they still care about cost and spend because that side of it how how much you spend if you can make that more efficient then that's going to increase the goal the other goal yeah we've we're just going to the end of a project at the moment so I'm hoping that the next couple of weeks I have a bit of time to reset and adjust um because because yeah it's not nice it's not nice feeling good um or not feel not feeling like this and I'm sure I'll get over it tomorrow but today's just not been not been a day uh and and then I was like well I want to do this because I like doing this stuff and this you know learning is so important to me I love learning um and I get I get really sad when I don't get to do stuff that I um that I like to do of the nonprofit so even in nonprofits a lot of the metrics are still going to be about money so that's a key thing to remember here and like the the other key thing I want to talk about on this slide is that money and revenue cost savings Revenue money all that stuff is generally speaking a lagging metric there's going to be other metrics that are uh precede it that are correlated with that metric but move faster and are easier to capture so we're going to go in a little bit more detail here okay so leading versus lagging so you have inputs and outputs so you can think about for those who are doing the class as well is anyone finished it yet and if so like how how how has it been since finishing it what did you think of it um if anyone's still doing it what do you think of it um yeah it's been uh it's it's it feels like I'm getting to the end now I'm getting close to the end now I didn't have a job for the P 1.5 years hession exploring data engineering oh that's nice is this like are you doing this course as well then about it like uh on a website you have the number of people who visit the website and then you have the number of people who sign up and then you have the number of people who buy like yeah I wish I had the time to commit to this boot shely burn out has contributed to my lack of motivation getting into it yeah I I completely get it like um I put off so many things um because I just knew that there was such an investment to do did that a lot in 2024 and um yeah I think so for me the free book Camp I only ended up doing this because I did the paid one and I was like well I signed up for the paid one and I committed to doing that and I was like well when the free boot came out first it was like well it makes sense to do both but it's been so much like extra work like an extra that's like an extra six weeks of content that I've signed up to do uh which has been you know it's been nice to like be able to um stream it and and and go through it with everyone but but it's uh yeah it was a lot of extra extra work that I wasn't intended on doing but actually this has really really helped prepare me for the other um for the other boot camp I think because there's so many things that I had to do as part of the that's going to help me with the next one I think awesome how are you finding the boot camp so far giman is that how you pronounce your name almost like a two-step funnel right it has two places where people can kind of like fall off and so um the example there the input there is the visits number of people who actually get to the website because just because they visit it doesn't mean they're going to produce Revenue like there's there's a probably a high probability that they don't and uh but there's going to be a small percentage of users who visit your website who do buy and then those people are going to be impacting the lagging metric on the other side the kind of the more Revenue in the sales metric on the other side so you can think of it as like if you have like a a process in place and you have a bunch of inputs into that process those are going to be your leading metrics in this example you have like web page visits and signups and maybe there's one Upstream of that of web page visits maybe there's like social media Impressions because you have people who saw the social media post and CLI but you also have people who saw the social media post and didn't click and so and then you can go down one layer and down one layer down one layer right you can do all sorts of really cool stuff that way so that's definitely one way that you can go uh and that's like a good example of leading versus lagging metrics and generally speaking the further uh away oh that's good I'm glad because I was wondering like um um I always I always get like really really bad paranoia that I mispronounce names like it actually like it gives me a lot of anxiety and like I get to the point where I'm like I've practiced that person's name so many times and then um and then uh I'm like okay well um I'm definitely going to get it right and then and then I forget as soon as I'm going to go say it I forget what was the pronunciation again it's so bad um I do like the boot camp I can't afford the paid one at the moment so the free one is beneficial to be honest um I think with the paid one like um a lot of it is just really understanding those fundamentals so all I would say is like some of the things that we've learned in the 3 one like how does partitioning work just really like research that yourself and just like understand how partitioning works I think um that's just one of the examples just because I did a lab lecture on that earlier uh and then some of the other things like um getting the infrastructure up and running that's beneficial anyway because because then you'll learn how the infrastructure side works and how you get things deployed so it's not a bad thing to to to only be able to do the the free one I think the the the paid one's just a lot more of a smoother experience if that makes sense and and obviously it's a Continuum right because if you have the social media impression to the website visit to the sign up to the purchase you can say that like okay you can actually probably put a dollar value on how much each social media impression is worth based on the percent of people who saw the post to the to the percent of people who bought which is usually a very very very small number but um in those cases uh that is called your conversion rate and that' be the full funnel that's like from everyone who was even a part of the funnel to to everyone who made it to the bottom of the funnel so and there's a correlation there and that's the conversion rate it's going to be the percent of people who saw the post on social media to the percent of people who actually bought which is usually a pretty steep drop off so that's the idea behind leading and lagging metrics and uh they are they are all very import to look at and um because sometimes maybe it's not a conversion problem maybe uh maybe you're converting at a pretty high rate maybe 10% are converting and maybe it's an Impressions problem where you're not getting enough uh a top of the funnel and that's the problem it's just you don't have enough leads or maybe and or maybe the conversion is the problem or or maybe the sign up step is the problem there's like all sorts of different places essentially every step of this funnel should be analyzed because every step can have problems so yeah um uh another thing that we're going to talk about here this is where we're going to have a probably an interesting discussion uh is that these uh leading and lagging metrics can also apply to your your life so for example uh if you're getting a job you could say that like I'm going to spend 100 hours practicing SQL to get ready for job interviews and then the and that's like your input metric and then the the out the the the final funnel metric is going to be like the um uh jobs received right and then you could also think of it as like you could have an extremely lagging metric which is like oh all those hours I spent learning SQL you know in five or six years I'm GNA be running a boot camp where I teach people how to get better jobs and so like that would be the extremely lagging metric it's even more than just like I got the job right it's that I got I I I learned all the stuff and then I taught other people and then they got jobs and so that the funnel keeps going on and so like anyways when you're like trying to get a job there's all sorts of different things that you need to think about right where you have do you have the skills do you have the learning do you have the necessary skill set to even apply and then you also have like the application process of like how many job applications do I fill out how many recruiters do I talk to that kind of stuff that's another important piece of the puzzle right and then you have like further down you have how many interviews do I give how many interviews do I pass right and then how many job offers do I get and which job offer do I accept right there's like a lot of steps in that process of this kind of lead leading and lagging metrics of like the professional world and one of the things you can think of is like okay the conversion rate in this case is how many hours uh of like practice like hours per job interview it's like a pretty good like rate way to think of like the um conversion rate of your job funnel and you might want to optimize that where you might be spending too much time applying for jobs that don't call you back or you might be spending too much time leak code practicing when it's like you're getting a marginal value from it and like who knows there could be a lot of different places in the funnel that you are not doing a good job so the whole idea is really there is a fstep funnel for like your learning and job environment where yeah I felt the same like especially with some of the functions that he um he went through and I'm like okay well what does this one do and what does that one do first step is your effort um this is going to be things like what should I learn how should I learn it like how many hours am I putting in here how much effort am I showing how do I show up and then you have branded networking which is like who are the people that I know how do I Market my skills how do I like get known for what I want to be known for then you have like the job inter like where should I apply how do I how am I successful in the job interview how how do I make sure that my skills match what the employers are looking for then you have job success which is like where you get the job and you are successful and you get promoted and like how do you keep learning and growing here and building up further and further up the ladder and then after that you have helping others and changing the world where you are able to get your job and get really far and then how can you teach and grow other people and get further along and have a an even wider more uh expansive impact on the world as you grow and um so we're going to go into each one of these a little bit more in detail because you want to be applying experiments in your life at at pretty much every single one of these steps so that you can get more input on like what is what is good and what is what is not working okay so we have the top of the funnel this is where you're learning and maybe networking the first two so one thing um that I've definitely not done on either of the boot campuses I've definitely not networked enough but it's really really hard like when you um when you do a 40 Hour Work Week content creation and then this full time and it's like well you've got to you've got to drop something and for me it's that kind of um that that networking aspect outside of content creation because I already have to do a lot of networking as part of LinkedIn and YouTube and all of that so it's like okay well I don't have then time to message loads on the Discord which I would love to do but it's just the thing that drops off so uh I think there's a lot of problems uh in that first bucket of like just jumping from tutorial to tutorial and like going too broad with your learning where maybe you're like I want to learn 13 programming languages because I think I'm going to be so good at the world right and like is that really is is knowing 13 really better than knowing three really well no all right and so there's going to be a lot of different things here and then obviously you have other things like you have people who are trying to sell you boot camps and people who are trying to uh you know you have paid you have paid stuff and free stuff and college and graduate program and like there's so many different choices that you want to make here um another big thing that I I think is very important here because I get this question a lot is around like I love that when he's like uh people are trying to sell you boot camps just giving a little D dig to himself it it's it's definitely a skill that that's hard to learn one of the things that I think works particularly well for people who don't necessarily like doing it is interacting with other people's posts rather than posting themselves eles because I think some people find posting themselves quite daunting where they find it a lot easier to interact with other people's content instead Zach should I go back to school should I go and get a master's degree and I think this is one of the big questions that's in this first bucket is and this is a an act of selfawareness when you're building out these learning funnels for yourself is how dedicated and motivated am I without structure right for example for me I'm on the extreme end where I built this boot camp out of thin air I didn't need anyone to tell me what what to do and how to build it I was just I'm going to build this thing and I'm going to do this thing and I'm going to show people how to do it and I'm going to kind of build my own path and learn my own way and that's essentially why for me I never I never found it interesting to go to graduate school nor did I find it necessary because I knew that like my own learnings and my own skill set is going to be good enough because I have such a thirst for learning that it doesn't matter whereas with other people uh they need that structure especially the earlier earlier you are in your career that's why I think for me I I'm grateful for my bachelor's degree in computer science I think that that was very good for me because that gave me a good like Foundation to kind of build off of so like a lot of times when people are like should I get a bachelor's degree I'm like probably like like like a boot camper place to get a bachelor's degree a lot of times is not going to be the case because you're not going to get the same level of foundation but uh that dep again it depends on the person because if if you have an extreme thirst for knowledge and you can uh you're a good self learner then you're probably good um let's talk a little bit this is really important as well like um so for example uh for me when I was when I was um when I was in school I really really struggled with um with needing structure L just because I hadn't really done a lot of computing when I was there so when I was in university having that structure was really really helpful um and and then as I've gotten better at my job as as I've gotten better I found having less structure a lot easier so like I can learn a lot of things by myself but what I struggle with I guess is I like to learn how to do things properly and so that's why I do things like boot this boot count because I like to learn how someone who's done it for a long time would do it properly because then I don't have to waste loads of time figuring out how to do it properly and there's so much like bad advice on the internet like there's literally so much advice on how to do software development um that like that that you you need to know what's good advice and what's not so um so yeah it it's definitely an important thing like but but it's one of the reasons why like I can do this and do it in a very ad hoc way and complete it when I'm comfortable rather than needing like this rather than having to follow the specific deadlines cuz I don't need the deadlines to motivate me to do it I'll just do it when I'm ready I just hate the fact of feeling like I'm not adding to the conversation and it just seems like noise it's not I guess it's not really about like um about needing to add um add like very very like a lot a lot of the time when I'm posting on like 10 I'm just posting like trash like like I'm I'm just like posting like troll posts like and that's just who I am that's just my personality I send memes to like colleagues I um I find things that that funny and that's just my personality but but you but by doing that that's how you build those relationships and and someone like LinkedIn because you're just posting and people are getting to know who you are as a person and what you like bit more about uh the second bucket uh where there's um you know brand building and networking because there's more to it than just being a engineer you have to also uh be um building your network of people who know you so that opportunities come your way and you can build relationships and I think the number one mistake here is just people don't do it they don't take it seriously they think that oh if I get good enough at coding a job will fall into my lap and like that's kind of a ridiculous way to go about it like I think I think of it similarly to like dating in that way where it's like oh yeah I'm GNA find the love of my life sitting on the couch like that's I think a lot of people like honestly believe that about their career and uh that's totally not the case um obviously uh networking is important I would say Don't just Network on LinkedIn like uh Branch out to either other social medias or do like inperson events I love inperson events iners events is really where I meet a lot of the people that I develop really deep Partnerships with so just just letting you know that's another good thing to think about uh uh some questions and experimentations here or like how should I Market the skills I've learned like a big thing there is like what job title do I want like how do I want to like go about it how do I want to grow my career do I want to Pivot I know for me that that experiment of how should I Market the the skills I've learned I've experimented with that question a lot in my career and like because I'm I get unsatisfied with being a data engineer and then I switch well even still like um I think uh you know sack's doing sack's also doing a course from someone in the more like business side so I think everyone does courses in inside that they're just uncomfortable with like oh they don't currently know because because they they want to learn that area but yeah um yeah I think the last cost that I did uh was so I did um I when when when I got my azour certifications I used a cloud Guru uh and it was really good to be fair I think plural site I've bought them now but at the time they would they had these like course contents for like the various exams and it was basically just like um it was basically just like all the topics kind of covered in in that course and it was really really useful actually for for the exam um but that's the last time I think that I did a course for uh for them I did uh so I did um the solutions architect one first and then I did the developer associate one and then I did the developer expert one but yeah just using a cloud Guru and then the Microsoft learn dos which are really basic by the way like you have to you definitely have to try the labs um rather than just go through the the learning docs which to being a software engineer then I go back to being an dat engineer and I've kind of like jump roped a lot with that question I've ran an experiment a lot and then you also have like who should I network with because I think that uh especially if you're early on like it's hard to know like what networks and what connections are going to actually produce value I think a lot of people who are early in their career they think that networking is just passing your resume to people and then them giving you a job and they think it's very like transactional like that when it's like it's not like at all like it's not like that at all you want to be when you're when you're thinking about building your network you really want to be thinking about how uh you are interacting with other people and supporting other people and showing up for other people and like providing them value in some way if you can those things are all very very useful for when you want to build your network so that's the idea behind uh the top of the funnel for your learning experience okay you have the middle of the funnel this is going to be brand building and job interview uh so there's a couple things here um I think a big one here that people make a big mistake on is they only apply to jobs where they meet all the requirements that's a big mistake very big mistake because like then you're just going to like you're never going to grow into a job you're only going to ever get a job that you're completely comfortable with which means that you're going to grow very slowly and that's not the way to go like uh I I one of my most viral posts on LinkedIn ever was one where I talked about how when I applied to the job at Airbnb it said that it need uh that the person they were looking for it was 10 plus years of experience and I had six and so and I got the job so like sometimes like you can because it's like if you can get the interview they already think that you have enough of like your background is already fitting enough and it's all about just being convincing in the interview at that point and if you can do that then great that's the middle of the funnel let's go a little bit further down okay so um you have this next part of the funnel which is going from that's funny um that's definitely something that I need to get better at just generally displaying um more confidence uh I think um it's weird because I feel confident and then like someone who will ask someone who I don't know will ask me something and I I'll just be like um so yeah that's an OD one um I think it's because uh like I think it's because of the way that my brain works you know because so so I find it quite difficult for things to come into my mind when someone's just asking me a question so typically um like if if if I just see or if someone's speaking to me me and they've asked me a question about something I I I I find it quite difficult just to picture it there and then um whereas if I like I'm able to like just have a quick Google of it and be like oh yeah that's what that is I know what that means um and and I'm absolutely fine it's just that like initial like being asked on on on the spot that I'm like I find it really hard to visualize I don't know if anyone else finds that interview to job success and job interview to job promotion um in this case we're no longer talking about fing out applications like you already got the interviews right um I think uh a big thing here right is um in the interview I think people get caught up with trying to prove themselves a lot of the time especially in big Tech I think this is less the case uh in other interviews but in big Tech in particular uh there's like it feels like the interview is one-sided where like you're trying to prove to Facebook that you're a good enough engineer but like that Facebook doesn't have to prove anything to you they don't have to show up and anything like that right and like I mean that's always like you know in all the big Tech freaking companies I've asked this question this is one question that I've asked in uh every single engineer who I um uh have interviewed with I say like if you could change one aspect of your job what would it be and see what they have to say listen to them that's why I will never work at Amazon right so it's like because Amazon is like just so hardore it's so intense and so like and they're not going to change right they're not going to change that's not something if you accept a ro at Amazon that's what's going to happen right is you're going to you're accepting a lot of intensity and you're accepting a lot of just like just a lot of work and so uh you need to learn about the whole company as well and just because you're interviewing and a lot of times like that's why I like talking to the individual Engineers not just the hiring manager because I feel like the hiring manager has a lot more pressure to put someone in a seat whereas the the individual Engineers on the team they generally don't have as much pressure so they like they are more likely to tell you like the complete truth about working at that company so um that's a big thing to remember always ask questions because it makes you look good too it makes you look good too because it makes you look less desperate it makes it look like you're also evaluating them and the the interview panel will respect you more for it and I think that's one of the big things for me that has helped me a lot in my career and another big thing is like ask the manager the hiring manager uh about stuff right try to identify um a bad hiring manager before you join that team I think that's one of the big things that I I was looking at in my career as well is that like if you especially like if you're trying to find like someone who uh is a little bit more micromanage or anything like that and uh there's a lot of good questions that you can ask them to like uh try to pick out some of that right to see like see like obviously you can't ask like are you a micromanager because they're everyone says no to that because they know that that's like a bad word but if you ask questions that are more like okay if I'm like I like asking this question if I'm two weeks behind on a project and I'm not sure where it's going to go how would you react as a manager and just see what they have to say because your manager if your manager only supports you when when times are good like they're not supportive and they're not going to help you and so because that's one of the big things like if you have an an unsupportive manager I also think a good um um yeah yeah and honestly I will say that I don't know something if I don't know it like genuinely if I don't know it but there are a lot of things that I know just my brain can't picture them on the spot uh what what it is like it's I know what it is but I can't think of the like the wording or like the the correct phrasing is is what I mean um so so I'm but I am pretty comfortable if if if I don't know something I'll just like I don't know that um I'll typically ask them would they be able to explain it to me if it's something that's similar to something else I'll say but I have worked with this before um which is I think I'm pretty sure is similar um but um yeah also another question another really good question to ask um a prospective manager if to figure out if they're micromanaging is just to ask them how work gets delivered to the team like that's a really good question how does like how does a Sprint look like for for their team like how do requirements get fed in um and if they're quite micromanager they'll probably like um they'll probably be the one who controls all of that rather than if you're working a team where like the team gets involved in it then it's a very different environment is literally the most detrimental thing that can happen to your career and so like picking them out before you get the job is so much better than having to deal with them after you get the job like it's so much better uh it's like finding the red flags right and dating same idea um another big thing is like don't just focus on coding coding is only one aspect of it like I think for me as a staff engineer at Airbnb coding was only like maybe half the job or a little bit less than half the job there's like a lot of more like leadership and uh diplomacy and compromise and design and scalability and a lot of stuff like that which are just very different things so like you know some other experiments that you want to think about uh on the other side here for job success and promotion is so I say how do I take my job to the next level so sometimes you might want to recognize I do have an unsupportive manager and I will not get promoted in this current role and I need to look elsewhere and I need to go and interview again and that's how I'll take my job to the next level and that would be an easier way to get to the next level than uh working really hard and like trying to please my toxic boss right and another big one is like how do I keep providing value so this one is an interesting one because a lot of times like I've noticed at these companies like they'll ask you to deliver on some big project that might take a year or 18 months but then you have to keep seeking out more and more projects and so a part of that is like okay how do I like Source all these projects and a part of that is like having a deeper understanding of the business and and talking with people and really understanding where some needs are and uh the other side of it is like just being able to recognize when things aren't scalable and and trying to find other pain points maybe even on your own team like weal we were talking a lot about on call this week in the infrastructure track and optimizing on call is always a very very Noble thing to do to keep providing value all right so we have the end of the funel so um you have two pieces of this right where it's like okay you have your job success you have your promotion you're living your best life right uh at some point you should be thinking about giving back and thinking about how you're going to uh teach other people or grow other people or save the planet and it doesn't have to be uh through teaching and mentoring obviously that can be one path that's the path I chose as mentoring and teaching but there's a lot of other ways that you can help and change the world and like make sure that you do that make sure that you don't just like sit back and you're like oh man like I'm making so much money in big Tech now and I'm just going to like you know retire early and uh sip martinis on the beach for the rest of my life when there's like a lot of problems in the world and like like as data Engineers with the sorry let me just um get this up I need to send this to everyone um it'll probably send people away but um uh what was it I've got a I've got honestly sorry this is such a deviation um but it's it I saw yesterday and I thought it was so funny um but um it's like this hi everyone I'm Sue Higgins I am head of Happiness here H happy 2025 happy New Year excited to be here I'm still buzzing from our self-hosted holiday parties where we ate wine and cheese at home and and joined our virtual secret santa potluck um via VIA Zoom today we are excited to hear from our leadership team who are going to tell us how our company is doing and the path moving forward um first up let's hear from our chief operating officer hello happy New Year um I am so excited to be here I am going to make this short because I have a heart out it to but I just want to say the company is doing really well our profits last year were 8 billion up 50% year-over-year that being said we are going to have to focus on efficiency this year so all departments related to departments will be cut uh if your department has the word Department in it it has been eliminated it's all about doing more with less or uh well doing less with more have a great 20 oh I loved it so someone sent this yesterday and I thought it was absolutely brilliant um watch the full thing in your own time but um so like so accurate like when you're seeing all of these um companies at the moment like you know meta everything just saying about how like um how they're making so many profits and then they're like oh we're going to do do layoffs as well they it's just like with disposable income we are incredibly incredibly incredibly privileged to be where we're at and and so if that's the case like it's we kind of have a responsibility to give back and to help other people and to help the world get become a better place beyond just making you know Facebook and Google a lot of money so make sure to actually think about that as like you get further in your career and like and don't get too money focused and remember that like it's all about impact it's not about money it's about impact and if you can remember that that will be another very important part of like kind of finishing off this funnel and getting to the end of your career so this is kind of a uh that's kind of like the whole funnel kind of thing we're about to uh break into um breakout rooms we'll probably break out for about 15 20 minutes uh let me uh go to the next slide here so and the best like the funny thing is is it's literally like oh yeah you know we just had a beautiful holiday in the malds and it's just like um and then you just like by the way you're all getting sacked bye-bye in our discussion uh this time we're going to have just uh three things here um one is going to be uh introduce yourself and your favorite SQL keyword whether that' be like from select group by having whatever uh that's the first and then then you want to talk about your what leading and lagging metrics do you find important in your career whatever those might be like part of it might be a learning metric or part of it might be an earning metric or part of it might be a balance metric or whatever whatever you want to talk about and then uh the last one is have have these changed as you progress throughout your career have you had any priority shifts let's talk about the kind of uh more of a product analytics example this is like more of like the actual so I'll I'll I'll share mine um not that anyone's asking but uh I think let me let me go back what was his examples then important your in your career whatever those might be like part of it might be a learning metric or part of it might be an earning metric or part of it might be a balance metric or whatever whatever you want to talk about and then uh the last one is have have these changed as you progress throughout your group have you had any priority shifts let's talk about so so when I was um when I started I just wanted to make enough money to kind of like I remember when I started thinking like 30,000 a year was like loads of money um and and um and so so for that like you know I used to think okay 303,000 a year you know I'm rich now I I have L of money and then literally like I'm very very um like what's next what's next what's next what's next um so I'm always focusing on the next thing so like whether that's um uh like whether that's uh learning so learning the DAT engineering boot count whether it's trying to grow my YouTube channel um question of favorite keyw I'm not sure what m is I'll have to have think that about the kind of more of a product analytics example this is like more of like the actual meat of this presentation today so um if you think about it from the perspective of say I'm trying to sell someone something uh that funnel has the top of the funnel could be like I pay Google so that I show up first on the Google search result and then they see my link that's going to be like the very first uh top of the funnel and then maybe they click on that link which should be the next layer this is really getting really frustrating for me though like for example I I went to search for the walk a walking pad earlier and a walk like the site for walking pad you know it's a pretty common you know it's a pretty common request walking pads are pretty common and literally it's like the fifth one down for that site and like and it's just like well I searched for walking pad because I wanted the walking pad I didn't search for treadmill because I don't want a treadmill I want The Walking pad specifically and it's just like this sorry I'm I'm I'm on a tangent here about Bloody um about buy them paying ads on on uh on on the beginning of like both both um Google and Microsoft have gone mad with the ad ads thing because all I want to do is go to the website that I've searched for and I've typed the name in of the website and I get filled with loads of ads for different websites and those websites have the name walking pad in them on their thing so it makes it look like you're going to the walking pad site I think it's really wrong hi Carlos how you doing right then they visit my web page right and then they sign up they give me their email it'll be the next layer and then uh once they are in the website then they will view the products and then they find a product they like and then they buy that product that's the next layer and then uh then they use that product for a while and they enjoy that product and they get a lot of joy out of that product that's going to be the next layer and then uh the the the final layer is they love the product and then they uh tell their friends about the product and that's where you get that kind of like testimonial and then they might want to buy again so you get like a kind of a big long kind of Journey for uh anyone in the in that kind of product space and you'll see we have the so we have testimonial as kind of the the final final Final end of this process because you can think about like the percent of people because you think about this way like okay on LinkedIn right I average like about seven million impressions a month right and so you can think of like okay of those seven million impressions in July when people were buying this boot camp okay how many of those are going to actually turn into uh into testimonials right so it gonna be like maybe 20 or 30 maybe if I'm lucky 30 y'all love me right and so it's like what's 30 divided by 7even million that's a it's a pretty small fraction there but that just goes to show that how these funnels uh have steep drop offs in a bunch of different places obviously the the very steep drop off here was the $1,300 that I asked you pay or $1,800 right that was like because if it was free there would be thousands and thousands and thousands of y'all in here and that would not be as uh good right because or like I mean then that would not have as much of a steep drop off if I did a boot camp that was free I bet I could get a couple more testimonials that way but then I would starve so it's a little bit that's so this is now free like they kept this bit it's a tricky problem right so anyways yeah have product analytics this is a a massive funnel we're going to kind of uh I have another funnel visualization for y'all we can kind of go over so this is going to be the kind of the funnel that works with business and I'm actually going to go into great detail here about how I have been thinking like a product manager when building out this boot camp and how I've been really trying to improve different areas of this boot camp to make things better for y'all and so that we can uh so that I can because one of my goals right is I'm hoping that I can get as many because right now everyone in this call you are probably going to be since it's like the fifth week of the boot camp you're you're going to be between this purchase step and this engaged step most of y'all are going to be in the engaged step at this point because if you're still tuning in to the live boot camps in we we five you're pretty engaged right so I've already got y'all down to this like fourth step of the funnel and I'm hoping that we can uh get through the whole funnel here with yall as many as I can and so uh this is um a very common funnel that is uh just it runs the world of business and we're going to go over in the same way we're going to go over that we went over the job application and like getting a job funnel we're going to go over how this works essentially from a different angle in more of a product analytics angle so let's uh let's dig into it okay so at the top of the funnel so one of the reasons that y'all are in this boot camp right now is because of something that I started two and a half years ago I started consistently getting Impressions on LinkedIn because um that's one of the beautiful things about organic reach in this current world that we live in is it's a great way that you can get Awareness on what you do and who you are and it can you know generate you revenue and it can help have you create more things right and so uh and keeping in mind that at every step in this funnel you can run AB tests you can run experiments you can do all sorts of analytics and having analytics AB tests and experim all that stuff if you can do all of that like at each step of this funnel you're going to have a better time so uh for examp I can totally tell that like linkedin's crafty analytics probably um wound him up for this because you don't get a lot of information from LinkedIn uh for Impressions there's going to be a couple different things here uh I'm going to talk about paid paid Impressions first and then we can kind of go over other things so one of the biggest things that you need to do when you are um looking for uh when when you have a bunch of different channels that are spilling into to your business is that you need to track where people are coming from so if you remember in the some of the other labs that we worked on there was that refer column in my website analytics and that is going to be the main way that I track that um I also track things a little bit like that is not that great because that only tracks at the website level like I want to actually get to a point where instead I track at the content piece level so that I can uh do conversions and look at things more from like this piece of content's better than that piece of content sort of idea so I can actually uh on an ad byad basis I can actually look at things uh with a finer grain of detail I do not have that detail right now I only so what I can do right now with my uh Impressions and conversion analytics is I can compare Twitter to LinkedIn to Instagram to Tik Tok right at the highest level because I can compare those domains from the referrer but I can't I don't have the I keep forgetting that I've intentionally turned him up like made him faster because I can't deal with slow talking and then I keep thinking why is he talking so fast is he hyper actual content links so I can't compare like a LinkedIn post to another LinkedIn post that is a future iteration on my analytics that I'm looking to do so that's going to be the first type of experiment that you can do is like really it's not even really an experiment it's more of like uh just an awareness because then if you have tracking all the way down to the piece of content then you can compare conversion rates between that piece of content and another piece of content and you can be like okay why did this piece do so much better and then maybe it's uh something in the writing or the hook or maybe someone else commented or there was like some other kind of anomalous thing that was going on in those pieces right but anyways for me even at the high level that I have I have that you know know just the platform level one of the things that that uh taught me in throughout my business was so when I did this stuff um so I have 31,000 followers on Tik Tok right it's not like I'm small on Tik Tok Tik tok's my third biggest platform and so um when I was selling uh my course and I made a video on Tik Tok about my course on my boot camp um nobody converted literally zero zero converted even though I had the tracking and no one bought and I was like Wow Tik Tok sad like Instagram converted great on a on a percentage basis Instagram was the best Instagram converted better than LinkedIn but LinkedIn convered the most because I just have such a big following on LinkedIn but Instagram on a percentage basis actually was the best and so um that was I I learned a lot just from my about my own social media usage and my own social media powers and like which platforms I need to invest more in so after selling this boot camp I learned that like the platforms I need to invest more in are LinkedIn Twitter and Instagram or X now I guess is what it's called but Twitter we still call it Twitter uh those three platforms converted really well and uh so that's one um now let's say I ran paid ads I don't really do paid ads because like I don't necessarily think that like the ROI on them is worth it but you could also Imagine okay how much a cost per click like you can iterate and experiment with the different creative art that you have the different marketing art that you have and you can see like oh people click on this more often than this and then that makes our ad dollars go go further so you can kind of experiment with ad creatives and then to understand like how to get more people to actually click and more people to actually convert and again interesting as well like um so I don't really go on I do have Tik Tok and I do have Instagram but I don't post actively on either of those um well I've I I I post on Tik Tok but I can completely understand how like Tech products don't do very well from there like I reckon like actual products like you know like clothing and and stuff like that does really well on Tik Tok but I imag yeah I can see how it's quite hard to get people away from it because people don't want to go away from Tik Tok they want you know if you buy stuff on the Tik Tok shop fair enough but um yeah I don't think people want to leave it I seem kind of chill today I wish I was kind of chill today um I was just saying to everyone how like today's just been a bad day like a bad day um I felt like really crap today um but I haven't cried like you know um which is you know part on the back usually if I've got a bad day like today I would I would be a bit te but I felt okay do I think a is the product of human evolution I mean I think everything is the product of human evolution te technically so yes like it's a hereditary condition so well this is the thing you know that this is what I'm you know if if if us bans Tik Tok I think this is going to benefit me in both ways because then I'm in the UK so I can start posting in in the UK and everyone who usually follows us people will be like oo um you know going to UK creators now and then every everyone from from the US will be going to LinkedIn and then I'll be like hi here I am I'm I'm just I'm I'm talking I'm I'm making stuff up really but you know yeah we'll see we'll see I doubt reckon they're going to come to something like because it makes them it's way too much money um it makes them way too much money like you want to put that you want to put a channel tracking or a Content creative tracking like I'm sure you've seen when you like click on a piece of content on Facebook it has like this weird like UTM Source equals it throws that in the URL and then your url is like really long and nasty it's because like a lot of these platforms already do that for you automatically linkedin's not one of them actually but uh that's going to be your first kind of set of different experiments that you can run at the very highest level in the funel this is just like this is experimenting with how many eyeballs can I get on the thing that I'm building and then it's like okay great that means that some of them are hopefully converting to a signup page or an email acquisition page uh for a long time on LinkedIn this was what I did to build my business was I said sign up for my newsletter and then I had a way to collect people's email and I I collected like 15,000 emails this way and I um uh I never even sent a newsletter and I remember people were getting mad because like I collected emails for like 18 months saying I was going to like start a newsletter and people were like so where's your newsletter bro I gave you my email and like I was like it's coming it's coming coming and I mean I actually did start it like about two months ago now and so it's like actually a real thing now but uh anyways that was a big thing I did because I didn't have another offer at the time I didn't have like a course to sell them or anything else so I was like well I'm just going to collect their email so that I can contact them directly later on so that I don't have to do this step of the funnel with that user again that sounds so sack I'm sorry but it does but you know I guess uh you got to do what you got to do and that's another very important thing to remember is that like you really do want to set things up in place so that you can get people to be they can start deeper in the funnel than where they're at so obviously when you're at this stage there's going to be a bunch of things that you can do here uh one of the big ones is going to be uh AB testing your landing pages I'm sure y'all remember in in the lab on Monday we covered uh how to do that with stats Sig on like how to do a blue button or a green button or a yellow button and like trying different kind of experiences obviously you can change the text and the colors and the designs and all that stuff as well um as a data engineer you probably want to work with a front end person it's really interesting though as well because like so for example if I go to my substack which is my newsletter um I have I nearly have 4,000 subscribers but I have uh 7,000 I nearly have 8,000 followers on there for some we we in but um but you you don't really get information about the F you don't have like an email list for the followers you only have an email list for your subscribers which is very annoying person on that unless you're also really good at HTML or something like that but I know there's not speaking of newsletter you should start yes you should start writing what would you like to start writing about that many dat Engineers who are great at HTML um so landing pages you want to optimize those to try to get them to convert to give you their email that's all that's this this second step is not even about anything else it's not about getting them to sign up for anything really it's about can I get a contact point from them whe most likely email maybe SMS if you're being like a weird company um another thing that you're going to want to test here and this is like less of an experiment and more of an optimization is your page speed so page speed uh the last piece of experiments that you really want to run on this like first uh initial contact point with your customer is going to be responsiveness uh which is like okay uh can we cut our conversion by by tablet or by um PC tablet or phone and does it look good on all of them and that's where like if you optimize for page speed and optimize for responsiveness then you're going to get the widest percent of users um both from uh the angle of it looking good and for it performing well because if you optimize for page speed that almost always means that your page is going to be less data and the less data you send the even for Worse devices it's still going to work pretty well even on bad devices or even on like not bad devices like old devices um I think I don't know if the audio has gone weird but it's going going weird for me I'm just G to um just going to go back a bit and see if it's it's an Impressions problem where you're not getting enough uh top of the funnel and that's the problem it's just you don't have enough leads or maybe and or maybe the conversion is the the problem or or maybe the sign up all right I know why it's gone weird my getting to the end of the day one lab uh other than the YouTube where is the stream uh I just upload it to YouTube at the moment um I um I'm I'm looking at some different options for like uploading to multiple like places but yeah YouTube at the moment you seem like you are in the mood of what do you mean um what do you mean by that is it do you just mean like um yeah to be fair I'm probably been a a bit less uh PC than I usually would be I should probably wear that in um most people have been asking about my data engineering experience I've been asked by a number of people to start writing I think it would be fun yeah definitely do it I think it's such a good way to like just get your thoughts out and I think doing both um for me doing a mixture of of YouTube and newsletters has been really really beneficial for me okay uh can we cut our conversion by tablet and that's another very important thing to remember is that like you really do want to set things up in place so that you can get people to be they can start deeper in the funnel than where they're at so obviously when you're at this stage there's going to be a bunch of things that you can do here uh one of the big ones is going to be uh AB testing your landing pages I'm sure y'all remember in don't necessarily think that like the ROI on them is worth it but you could also Imagine okay how much does it cost per click like you can iterate and to invest more in are LinkedIn Twitter percentage basis actually was the best and so um that was I I learned a lot just from my about my own social media usage and my own social media powers and like which platforms I need to invest more saying I was going to like start a newsletter and people were like so where's your newsletter bro I gave you my email and like I was like it's we're back we're back we're back where we need to be it's coming and I mean I actually did start it like about two months ago now and so it's like actually a real thing now but uh anyways that was a big thing I did because I didn't have another offer at the time I didn't have like a course to sell them or anything else so I was like well I'm just going to collect their email email so that I can contact them directly later on so that I don't have to do this step of the funnel with that user again and that's another very important thing to remember is that like you really do want to set things up in place so that you can get people to be they can start deeper in the funnel than where they're at so obviously when you're at this stage there's going to be a bunch of things that you can do here uh one of the big ones is going to be uh AB testing your landing pages I'm sure y'all remember uh in the in the lab on Monday we covered uh how to do that with stat Sig on like how to do a blue button or a green button or a yellow button and like trying different kind of experiences obviously you can change the text and the colors and the designs and all that stuff as well um as a data engineer you probably want to work with a front-end person on that unless you're also really good at HTML or something like that but I don't know there's not that many data Engineers who are great at HTML um so landing pages you want to uh optimize those to try to get them to convert to give you their email that's all that's this this second step is not even about anything else it's not about getting them to sign up for anything really it's about can I I feel like I'm getting a c on how to sell to people at the moment like you know let's just just write this down Zach you know this is going to be useful for when I um bring out my uh how to not get conned by courses that that to be fair I'm not I'm not saying like um that that that um this this is a really valuable cost so is the um boot camp but I have definitely seen uh courses on LinkedIn where you just think this this just seems like a money grab they often seem to be the ones where it's like you know where it's like it looks like a absolute pyramid scheme of basically the cses teaching you how to sell to other people and the C and what they're teaching you is basically what they're doing to sell to you do I like guns no I don't like guns I get a contact point from them whe most likely email maybe SMS if you're being like a weird company um another thing that you're going to want to test here and this is like less of an experiment and more of an optimization is your page speed so page speed uh the last piece of experiments that you really want to run on this like first uh initial contact point with your customer is going to be responsiveness uh which is like okay uh can we cut our conversion by tablet or by um PC tablet or phone and does it look good on all of them and that's where like if you optimize for page speed and optimize for responsiveness then you're going to get the widest percent of users um both from uh the angle of it looking good and for it performing well because if you optimize for page speed that almost always means that your page is going to be less data and the less data you send no no no I'm not saying um I'm not saying this is a pyramid skin I'm saying the ones where it's like literally like I'm going to teach you how to why why you're not like I'm going to teach you how to make money and then the way that they teach you how to make money is just by making you teach other people how to make money yeah it's a bit sorry um I didn't get that went way over my head then and the even for Worse devices it's still going to work pretty well even on bad devices or even on like not bad devices like old devices it's still going to uh work pretty well and then you can optimize for a wider range people yeah I heard about that um that PhD student actually who um quit quit a PhD to to be uh to teach your networks on like only fans and I thought that was that was fantastic to be fair thought it was great I was like fair play and like it's funny because everyone sharing her stuff is just getting her more views and getting her momy which is just yeah yeah I love to get the cost on how to get a paying job and they haven't done it themselves yeah oh like um yeah like there's loads of ones where it's like hard to get into software engineering and they haven't ever done like software engineering in in um a like commercial setting I'm not saying you need to to to but like but I think this a massive difference between just doing a few projects here and there for like clients like on the Fly and actual commercial software yeah I'm just streaming on YouTube at the moment um so I use OBS at the moment I am looking at I am looking at better options I just I just haven't figured out what option yet I've got a few different options op I need to research them um so I'm sort of like making changes at the moment to to to to move things over to a different stream and I kind of want some that does both video editing and streaming and and and um about my podcast as well so I've got a few options that I'm looking at remember that not everyone in the world runs on an iPhone 14 without with the best specs right there's a lot like that's not even the average that's like the top 10% of the world uses that so um so this is the first piece of the funnel we're at top of the funnel here so that's how you can get down to at this point uh now at this point we have an email we have an email for people that uh we can then contact them directly we no longer have to pray that the LinkedIn algorithm shows my content to them anymore and we can just contact them directly okay so now we have middle of the um this is going to be where you are going from signups to uh purchases right that's going to be a big uh kind of Step that is the next kind of Step of this puzzle um so purchases are going to be uh an interesting one because of a couple different things um the experiments in purchase are trickier because of the fact that like you have more risk when you're like fiddling with stuff like for example if I was like uh what's the creepiest thing you've ever seen on link so I guess it's not really creepy but I really just like it when people like like share like images of people to get attention so like for example there was a girl like um I think Who had who was like brilliant in like math or science or was it was it but everyone was making fun of her looks and um then what they were doing was they were sharing her picture to to be like let's raise awareness for her um without her permission like sharing her picture without her permission is not to me supporting her if you want to support her you know make a post about it but you don't need to share her image whereas sharing her image is intentionally just trying to use her to get views um so so that was one what I really didn't like and then people who like share like um like there was a man who uh killed loads of women um so he killed his girlfriend and his girlfriend's mom um and his girlfriend's sister I think or was it it was his ex-girlfriend he with a bow and arrow and like loads of people are just sharing his image on on LinkedIn um to get engagement and Views and and uh you just like what the the like what is going on oh look are you tired you can leave go to bed I hope you're doing well hi nice to nice to meet you and I am doing very well thank you yeah to be fair like if if anything's traumatic or if there is anything that I think is violating I I'll just hide it I don't I don't really want to see anything like that on my feed if I was like hey everyone you can get you can get 80% off my boot camp right now like some of y'all in this call would be like can I get that discount right and it's like so you kind of uh like some of your pricing experiments can run a risk of upsetting current customers so you want to be careful about how you are doing that I even remember like uh during this boot camp this is like something I think Diva might be on this call but I think someone Divia is someone who uh is in this boot camp and uh like when I released the self-pace course I recognized that the combined version I priced it at the wrong point you know I priced it too low and uh and um a couple of y'all in the boot camp called that out and you were like why can they get all of the content for less and so I I I put the I actually ended up raising the price before anybody bought though now and that's why I was grateful for y'all because I ended up raising the price a little bit to make all the the to make the pricing structure fair for everyone and so that's a very important thing to remember um but at the same time like when depending on where you're at like there is uh and where what you're selling pricing is a little bit more flexible like for example um at Airbnb right they have their own pricing stuff they have ai and ml that sets a lot of prices and so they have to understand elasticities so elasticity is essentially the more you raise prices the fewer people will buy but also it's also true the other way around the more you lower prices the more people will buy and so there's usually a sweet spot in the middle there where you optimize for like the integral of purchases times price and that's going to be like where you are going to make the most money but not necessarily that can also um like you know for example if you're like Rolex I I highly doubt that the the integral for them of like charging $50,000 for a watch is the right place to go they like they're not Walmart right they're not going for volume right they're going for margin and so uh like it really does depend on your strategy as a company as well so uh pricing can be a big thing and also remember on the pricing page right so this is something that I did and uh I'm curious uh what y'all are going to think about about this but uh I don't know if y'all have ever heard of like the decoy strategy before uh like cuz you know what Starbucks like a lot of times like how it works is like if you have small medium large like the small is four the medium is 550 and then the large is six and then it's like you get the large every time like because it's like the pricing structure is stupid the pricing structure is really weird right and so for me that was like one of I had a pricing strategy that I put in place in this boot camp that was way more successful than I thought it was going to be actually it was like because I thought like initially when I came up with like the different tracks like the analytics infrastructure and combined tracks for this boot camp I thought that most people were going to buy a single track and no uh I think it 65 think 65% of you uh bought the combin track and it makes sense because y'all are smart because if you look at the um the per hour basis of uh the content um if you buy a single track uh the content is $30 an hour if you buy the combined track the content is $18 an hour so you get a way better deal because it's only five because the way you think about it is like it's only $500 more for double the content so it's like really in like 1,800 like if we were if it was on the on on the dollar Ford dooll basis it should have been 2600 but y'all like were were smart and like you saw that like oh yeah this is going to be a lot more content and I'm going to learn a lot more by buying the combin mind track and that was the whole point is that because I wanted people to be invested I wanted people to feel like they were getting the best option I wanted people to buy the large right and so that's where when you're thinking about pricing and thinking about how you're going to build your products like thinking about like how you want to nudge people to buy something uh like like is definitely one of the one of the one of the things that is an important thing to do because I personally think that like that's the right way to go like and like because then it gives it also gives people options because I also recognized that like $1,300 and $1,800 is like not cheap so I wanted people to be able to get in at a lower price point if that like served them so that's kind of the idea behind pricing and how you can kind of fiddle with pricing to you know get what you want out of what to change customer customer Behavior even okay I also think as well I with things that this is um that pricing really affects like um what whatever you charge can it affect what service you give because if you give um if you're going to charge like so so I've done Zach's course here and I've also done Milan jeck's course his was a c pragmatic architecture course uh really good as well but his was much cheaper his was like only $200 um but but basically the content was you know pre-recorded Ed it there wasn't any like you know Community there there wasn't it wasn't like it was a c it wasn't a boot camp um and so the level of service that you get when you do a c versus a boot camp is very different so now we are getting uh deeper into the funnel here uh now uh at this point y'all have bot uh so thank you like y'all y'all have made it this deep into the funnel of my boot camp and uh you have the pricing structure elasticities y'all learn about that most of y'all bought the large and then you want to get them engaged and retained so um a big part of that is onboarding uh getting uh a smooth onboarding process uh some things that I tried to implement there were were like the intake form to get people into groups I also uh got people onto the GitHub as quickly as I could and also got people like in the Discord chatting and starting to build community and that was uh I feel like mostly a win um later on uh this is something I'm not doing right now it's something I'm implementing my developers are implementing this is not as important for the boot camp but for self-paced people it's very important is uh notifications to kind of if someone hasn't done anything in the boot camp in like a week or two we're going to try to get them back by sending them an email and being like yo like come watch a come watch a lab and kind of getting people more uh retained that way um another thing here is around schedule uh schedule's an interesting one I think schedule uh can be very good or like I like having a predictable schedule I think that that's a very important thing of like oh we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this and we're like going through it and having that kind of piece of the puzzle and then also keeping yall engaged through content right and content is a big thing and another part of the schedule piece that I think has been important and it's yeah this is this is what I was thinking like this one's definitely going on about like a lot about like um how to deliver a course uh but to be fair this is the only um this is the only one uh where where like he's he's talking like this but I think it's useful to to to to understand the like the the business side for sure it's one of it's one of the other for me it's really useful as a content creator anyway just to understand and how he his thought process and how he generates income things of why I make the Q&A on Thursdays I make that uh exclusive is because I want y'all to stay on schedule too I don't want y'all to just be like Oh I'm just going to not do the homework or like oh I'm just going to do the homework on the last minute and it's like no I want to incentivize y'all to like do the homework like on time so that it feels like you don't have to cramp and that like you retain it better and like so that you can have more retention like because that is the goal here I'm trying to make you guys better data Engineers so that's kind of the idea behind uh the retention part of this funnel it's a very important piece of the funnel I think it's the one of the most overlooked pieces this is the piece where you go from okay you acquired a customer to you delighted a customer and customer Delight is one of the most important parts of building a successful product that is I think that's like a Jeff Bezos quote or something like that um so we have uh that's essentially the retention part of the funnel then uh we have the last piece here we have uh where we go from uh engagement to uh referral and testimonial so there's a couple things here I think uh of like how do you how do you do that right where it's like you have someone who's engaged you have someone who is doing the effort they're doing the job they're doing the homework right they're doing all the things they're doing what they're supposed to do right and they're and they're doing the program well like to really have someone go from engaged to testimonial or engaged to referral is you need to impact their life in a way more than just giving them knowledge you need to like really shift them in some way like giving them a network giving them a mentor giving them that's one of the big things that I why I added the uh the mentorship program into the boot camp is because I know that that is going to be at least as valuable as this boot camp is right now because one-on-one mentorship is incredibly valuable especially with the talented people that you're going to be uh paired up with so that is something to really uh think about and because one of my goals is like I am not here to teach you data engineering I'm here to make you a data engineer those are different right those are like because one of them is like oh cool that's nice it's like reading it from a book right and the other one is like no I'm actually doing it I'm actually doing it I'm writing the sequel I'm writing the pipelines I I have the job I'm making the money right and that's like a very uh those are different very different and uh some other things that you want to think about here when you're converting from engaged to testimonial is yeah I I think it's really useful as well like um to understand uh and to understand what makes a good cost as well I think is really important because you want to deliver value um I don't know if anyone's uh like heard about like the like tech tech platform like I think he's is launching soon but yeah that that sounds really exciting you also want to be thinking about LTV like the lifetime value of that testimonial of like okay this person like loves the content and like is all about it and it's like how much value am I going to get from that like myself and how does that how does that kind of perpetuate into the business and that's one of the things that I think is important to um recognize when you are um if you're working in a high margin business like what I'm working in like is like okay how much am I investing back into my students and stuff like that because then it's like okay is that like because the way I look at it like long term like the mentorship program I actually look at yeah I I I know I'm investing some money into that but like I actually think I'm going to get paid back so like I'll I'll make money from it actually I'm going to make money from it so um and like it'll be awesome and so and and because one of the big things I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to build a community I'm trying to build a kind of an apparatus of a way to get people to learn the skills learn what they need to learn and then get mentors who can get them to the next level because you need mentors who can then kind of because obviously I'm speaking to like 50 of you right now and I'm personally I don't think I would be a good Mentor for all of you there's going to be some of you who like you disagree with how I see the world and that's totally okay and like but that means that like my career advice might not stick with you as well as someone who is a little bit more personalized to you and that's actually what I'm going to be doing um in the next couple weeks is I'm going to be adding um a personalized mentorship uh kind of intake form where there'll be so like just how we did group matching based on like time zone and stuff like that we're going to have uh some do mentorship matching as well and that will be another thing that will be uh kind of added into I'd love to have Zach as my mentor because he teaches things the way that I think them um and it's quite a it's quite a chaotic break things break past style and that's that's my style as well um though yeah but but like I'd really struggle with a mentor who's very um by the book very uh like what's the word uh like process driven um I struggle with that personally this program uh as we go forward here so anyways that is the next piece of the puzzle is to get people to go all the way down the fun and then uh because then they become your BR Champions and then you don't have to Market anymore because at that point you have so many people that love what you do and they like they they have such a profound appreciation for what you're doing and for what you did in their life that you the the Boot Camp or whatever thing you're making sells itself at that point because you have Word of Mouth and you have you have that person tells their friends and that person tells their friends I'm already seeing that I know y'all are telling your friends because like I'm not doing any marketing right now and I'm still selling self-paced courses I'm still I'm still selling like a couple self-paced courses a day and so like I know y'all are doing right now even right so thank you thank you for marketing for me I appreciate it a lot so anyways that is the funnel and one of the things I'm trying to talk about here with funnel stuff is you'll notice that like a lot of what I talked about there is um there's metrics every single one of those steps has a metric you can measure right and just like what I was talking about before where it's like we go all the way back to Impressions like okay or we go back to this slide here right so we have the top of the funnel here of Impressions and like how many people actually make it down to this bottom one right it goes from like Millions to like tens and that's like a a steep drop off but then that's how you find your you find your tribe and you find your people and you find the people who really um you know really care about what you're doing so anyways that's kind of like when you're thinking about how to be a product manager this is the kind of stuff that you should be thinking about as a data engineer as well because one of the things is is like if you're doing product analytics and you're a data engineer you should be able whatever metric you're coming up with you should be able to come up with a cohesive story of like where in this funnel does that metric play right I'll just give a couple examples here real quick so for example I worked in notifications at Facebook so notifications uh is uh part of the retention step right because that's how you bring people back that's how you get people engaged and that's how you get people to uh really keep uh using your product right another one that I worked on at Facebook was friending so friending is going to be um also in the retention step right because the more friends you have on Facebook the more likely it is that you come back so another area I worked on was npx which is new user experience new user experience was actually more in this like signups and email acquisition because that was a lot around like measuring the effectiveness of ads but then it was like it kind of LED between the two it was between uh the email acquisition and the engage retained CU Facebook conveniently doesn't have this purchase step because it's free right so uh they they go immediately from sign up to uh to a retention problem and they have a purchase step on the other side right on the ads side um so and that's a great example of like for them it's like when when an Advertiser purchases an ad that's going to be the middle of this right and that's where Facebook is a crazy crazy product because of the fact that they actually have two funnels right they have a funnel for users and a funnel for advertisers and they have to deal with both of them and they have like this kind of like two you can tell as well like um that Zach really finds the business side very very interesting in this because this is like a 65 minute long video and a lot of his videos are like 45 to 50 minutes long um but but he's very passionate about this this area exided thing so the things I like about this boot camp is that it's just one funnel right because the other side is just me I I thought about it in the future of like how I might want to do this where I have like a set of Educators and a set of students and like kind of essentially taking kind of the platformed like Facebook approach to things but right now it's me so anyways you can see that like if you're a DAT engineer and you're creating metrics for product analytics if it doesn't fit in this funnel anywhere then it's most likely a waste of time that's like straight up like that's that's my perspective right is like if you're not like building something that fits into this funnel it's probably a waste of time there are some minor Exceptions there but then like you wouldn't be a product data engineer anymore like for examp example if you're working on like infrastructure efficiency where it's like you're measuring the efficiency of the infrastructure or like how quickly or how fast things are made or how much aw dollars you're spending that really doesn't fit into the funnel because it's not really a part of the user experience it is in the fact that it raises essentially what it does is it raises the cost to acquire a customer like the CTA cost to acquire that's also called action but it's kind of both so in that case it would uh impact the signups right because you would have a kind of a a cost to acquire that customer and then that would be the metric that the the additional infrastructure cost would then impact in this funnel so that's a big thing to remember think about everything that you do in product analytics always be thinking about funnels because if you're thinking about these funnels you're going to impact the business way more and then it will also help you put your work into context and help you build more robust data models that can help illustrate this funnel and illustrate this user journey in a more uh Salient and effective way so yeah product analytics is tough but like if you think about it as a funnel it's a little bit easier okay um one of one is like how to think like a product manager there's really only one question that you really want to be thinking about here as a data engineer there's more in the product management space than this but at every step of the funnel thinking about what is causing pain what is sparking joy and if you can think about that of like what is causing pain and what is sparking Joy through every step of your user journey and you try to optimize for joy and minimize pain then you will be a lot more effective product manager and uh I'm going to go over some more examples like within the boot camp I know this like presentation feels kind of meta where I'm like I'm giving a about the boot camp in the boot camp but I hope you are getting some value out of this so let's talk about some examples here from the boot camp so from that top level right so it's kind of like breaking the fourth wall a bit isn't it uh I'm talking about Impressions or maybe uh I'm talking about the perspective student uh so one of the things that sparked joy in some of y'all was my content on LinkedIn Tik Tok or Instagram about data engineering and y'all probably were like wow I'm learning a lot I I think this guy knows his stuff I think I can I can trust him with doing uh with te me and that was a big thing that y'all did and some we should do like um a drinking game for whenever Z mentions meta on Facebook yall even uh took it a step further and you wanted deeper Knowledge from on Netflix that one as well and you signed up for my newsletter uh at some point in the last two months and that's where I now have your email and I was able to uh connect with you on a deeper more personal level so these are examples for me of things that I did right uh that sparked joy that brought customers to me that were a big part of the user Journey that helped me uh build a bigger and more successful boot camp so then you have the new student so when you paid your thousand bucks or whatever your thousand is dollars uh one of the things that people got was you got immediate access to all of the videos um you could easily look at I mean there was I I put I I started at the beginning of the boot camp there was I think there was 10 I had all the the the first two weeks of data modeling from V1 and all the interview uh presentations I did and so you got immediate access to that content and that was something that probably sparked joy in a lot of you because you're like wow my I got my money's worth and there were on the other side was the hiccups around getting y'all added to the GitHub and getting y'all added to the deeper level of the content and getting you on Discord and that stuff not being automated and that being like a very manual painful process that was something that did not spark Joy I know I'm sure y'all have seen that Meme of that like Asian lady who's like this Sparks Joy this does not spark Joy you know what I'm talking about like I like I always like when I'm in my product manager like head space that Asian lady is like in my head the entire time I needed to have like I was trying like I should have put that Meme in here that's oh man that's that's going to be in the next in V3 that is definitely going to be in this presentation so you think of like okay I'm thinking about the new student this is one thing that sparked joy and one thing that sparked pain okay what about engaged students um so I think another thing that spark Joy was uh getting everyone into groups so that you could have a kind of a group of people that you felt were going through the same trials and tribulations as you and so you could feel less alone and then also uh you feel happy when you're going to be matched with a mentor because you feel like this whole boot camp was worth it because you're like wow I can't believe I listened to Zack talk for 60 hours that's a lot of Zack and um and now I get to have a mentor who's going to help me maybe get a referral to places or learn about interview skills or whatever things you want to learn from that Mentor you can you can get that from them and uh I think a place that I messed up um in uh for the engaged students which is going to be most of you is uh I think this boot camp has been a lot I learned I've learned I mean this boot camp has even been a lot for myself like in coming up with the content and talking with all every day and one of the things I've learned is that like I think in the next boot camp I will scale it back just a little bit I think that I will not do quite as many lectures it will be uh I think still six weeks but I'm going to com condense some of these lectures and and come back compack them down and uh kind of focus more a little bit deeper on quality and um not quite as much on quantity because I think that will help y'all feel less overwhelmed from the intensity of the boot camp but on the flip side I appreciate y'all showing up and coming to all these lectures because I think that that is also it shows that you can do hard things and uh I I really do appreciate I can confirm actually have like from doing the the paid one like they justes feel like there's a notable difference in like the condens and to the pointless which is really good for me because I like people are I like content that's condensed to the point even though I fluff I am a very fluffy person I say that I'm Fluffy I'm quite direct but when I talk I talk I Tau to fill the gaps uh your engagement here so that's uh kind of when I was thinking about the pain pain and joy of my boot camp students that's a big thing I was thinking about and then on the last one it's like okay I think uh for the referral and testimonial I think it's uh when one of my students lands a better job from the skills they learned here uh they're going to be very happy they're going to be very grateful they're going to freaking tell all their friends and they're going to like love it and and that's going to be like the big part of this user Journey because I'm trying to build a sustainable business here where like I change lives every six weeks or like or not every six weeks but a couple times a year for six weeks I change lives right and I can get people to um like really level up and uh you know get inspired by how they can kind of build things but so the idea here is you can see one of the things the skill set here is I'm a data engineer right I'm not a product manager I have never been a product manager I that's not my cup of tea uh most of this skill set like where I learned this skill set is by building startups and failing where I you know I learned this from like building the magic the Gathering app and from building art lineup and all these other startups that I created and failed at and I learned a lot about like customers and the customer journey and joy and sadness and all that stuff from that angle and and you do want to like these are both important like you do want to like have this strategy so I just gave you my strategy of like how I'm thinking about the boot camp and how I've been thinking about being how I've been a product manager throughout this boot camp journey and not just because I could have just been a um a lecturer right and then like okay this is what you bought thanks byy right and then like kind of thinking about it from that angle of like okay I'll give them exactly what they asked for and then and that's it and and not try to Delight anybody and I don't know that's not the way to go though that's not how you uh that's not how you build a legacy but uh that's like kind of like that's where being a product manager though and like or not necessarily being a product manager but like thinking about things like a product manager can make your data engineering skill set a lot better because now each one of these things every single one of these things is a metric right where it's like here it's like okay like one of these metrics is like okay how many people are converting from LinkedIn Tik Tok and Instagram right and how many people are signing up to my newsletter easy metrics to track right okay here is like okay how many people are buying the boot camp I would say that this isn't really just about product management though it's it's about sales it it's it sales it sales leads that's that's a lot of it it's understanding the sales aspect of it and as someone is acting as a CEO of his company you have to think about that you have to think about how you're going to be making money and then watching a video immediately right and then also how many people are buying the boot camp and then messaging me about not having access to GitHub right within a day or X number of days or whatever right those are two metrics easy to track right here okay how many people are doing the group work right that's another metric that we can easily track okay how many people are actually showing up to the mentorship sessions that is something that I am tracking I'm going to have all my mentors track uh um and then also how many people are dropping out of the boot camp that was something I actually had an an initial indicator that the boot camp might be too intense uh in week two when I had that refund deadline and you know I think like about eight people dropped out and so uh and that was my I was like wow yeah this is going to be a lot metric right uh here um how many people land a job and change their lives another metric because I know if they land a better job they're going to tell me about it and I'll have that metric obviously that would be like a that' be a crazy data pipeline right where it's like like I have it like pars all my DMs and it's like an llm model to see like oh this person got a new job because of the boot camp and then it like adds a row right that would be crazy that' be so crazy but um I think this is where like um I think Zach's comparison of people doing the boot camp like the paid version versus the free version isn't necessarily a good comparison because his when when he's doing it free like that's targeting a lot of different a different Market because he's targeting people who can't like who can't necessarily afford the the paid version and a lot of the time when you can't afford the paid version it's because um it's because of where they are in their career um so like they're a student or like um they're trying to find their first role um and so if you've like got a C that is requires an advanced level of understanding when they're starting out they're not going to be able to get through it as quickly and and and do it as quickly so having that comparison of oh you've got like people who have started a boot camp who are all highly competent and have been like software Engineers who are kind of transferring to data engineering or the data analysts who have transfer into Data engineering Etc versus people from around the world who um who are just starting out it's a very it's a very different comparison you can't compare whereas maybe a better comparison would be is if he had a beginers c and he compared that with a free free beginners Cass as well anyways metrics definitions funnels thinking about things like a product manager these are how you build beautiful amazing products and this is how you make a business better right or make a business from nothing that's what I did I mean I made this business from nothing and like I know that this business is going to be wildly successful so and like and a big thing a big part of that is thinking about each step of the user journey and how they are feeling think about emotions empathy it's important stuff okay so um we're almost uh like we're almost out of time here at least this is the last slide uh this is what we're going to do for the homework this week is uh you're GNA pick a product that you love using whether that be uh um like LinkedIn Spotify Facebook Instagram whatever uh so I want you to do that I want you to describe the user journey of that product uh from when you signed up like what about the product when you signed up were things that you liked and like why did you sign up initially and then also uh why are you coming back why are you staying engaged and also if you spend money like why what what um what are the things that cause you to spend more money like uh on that product uh that like I want you to talk just in detail about that I expect like a couple paragraphs this is not like a small amount of work here uh and then the last what you mean soorry could you explain that that in a bit more in a bit more uh words I guess step the homework for this week is I want you to then describe three experiments you would like to run on this product to see if it would improve the experience so and this is going to be uh you're going to detail out the allocation of each test cell and the different conditions you're testing like for example I'm going to do 50% test 50% control and I want to change this aspect of it or this aspect of it and try to be creative here don't just be like I want to make the button red or blue not like the basic examples I was giving in the labs but like really try to put on your product manager hat there and think about like oh this is what I'm going to do differently or I'm going to do uh I want to change this aspect of it or like I I I've always been annoyed by this feature and I want to change it in this way and then the last thing is like I want a hypothesis from each experiment about like what you think would change or which metrics you think would change like the leading and lagging metrics and just assume that you have access to every metric in the world because uh you're probably going to pick a product that has all the metrics in the world anyways so uh and just think about like which metrics you think are going to change like either drop or raise and really think about like potentially what what could go wrong in the experiment as well uh so that's going to be the homework for this week congrats on getting to the end of the day two lecture I'm so happy that you're taking this time to invest in your knowledge and getting better at data see you at the next \[Music\] one exactly yeah exactly I think that is so important like because like I'm I'm I've been a software engineer for nearly 10 years and I don't think this this boot camp is easy I think it's manageable but I don't think it's easy um so I could understand people starting out been like this is this is a lot make sure to I'm just watching the lab now switch to the other tab so that you get credit for it ex I of you check out the lab what I want you to do is make sure you're on the latest version of the code base uh pull pull from Main if you're not you're going to need to uh set this uh stat Sig API key environment variable if you have not done that uh I can show youall how to do that if you um uh like later on like hopefully hopefully you all have some experience with setting an environment variable but so flask is a way of building okay so let's go to kpis I'll be very interested to see how um how the homework is able to mark it this week is that's like quite a that's quite a fluffy homework task so we shall see um I'm just gonna okay so we want to set this so out a web server so what I want to uh do is first I want to show you'all how to set this up so let me um open Terminal real quick okay I think as well like because there's no added benefit for finishing before the deadline like I think there was like some small incentives but there wasn't any big incentives to finish before the deadline there's a lot of people who are kind of making their way through it quite slowly like for me for example um and and to be honest I'm I'm not good at following a deadline anyway like um because because I'm not digesting it then I'm just rushing through it uh whereas if I take it at my own place with everything else that I've got going on then I'm much more likely to learn it and it's going to stick better okay so I want to be in uh here and the whole idea here is like if if you do um Python and then you do Source server.py where do I get the a I key from is it like um in the chat just having oh do I need to create my own yeah let me just create my own account on stat this is what I mean though like I'm just going to show you here right I search for statti which is the the product that I want to use I've I've searched specifically for statti and I'm take I'm going to take a screenshot of this and I'm going to do a run I'll just create this off off here uh I can sign it with Google cool yeah yeah it just annoys me because I've searched specifically for this company and then you've got first hog and then you've got stat Stig holding your back and they put stat Stig in the name and then you can see discover why split out perform satic and then you only actually get to the one that you actually want to use here just think it's wrong like really annoying really annoys me um yeah so I've got an API key the set STI I'm just gonna put that in the this is going to set up you see how it says running on this uh domain if we go to that uh domain you'll see like hello this is a flask API make sure to this is going to set up you see how it says running on this uh domain if we go to that uh domain you'll see like hello this is a flask API so that's essentially uh this is like the hello world sort of web server and what you can do is what I want to show you though is if I go to tasks right you'll see that I'm like okay it's saying experiment group Green and then it's saying odd tasks for blue and green even for red and orange so that's probably wild right and you'll see like I have a a user identifier here so this is all okay so I'm just um I'm just going to create a virtual environment now um for oh um install e yeah I must you just sa a secret key look F letter okay okay so it's not actually getting my API key um my I think I wonder if uh you need to um um oh it's export isn't it in I'm thinking it cool uh right oh hello this is a flask API all based on configurations from stat Sig and this is an experiment I'm doing uh called like button colors or something like that and uh we're going to go over in more details how this works from stats Sig but let's kind of like walk through that code real quick first so you'll see here uh we have this um app do route uh it's on line 33 here uh this tasks route which is going to be what ize this uh this link for this web server and then uh you'll see we essentially are trying to figure out the way to get the the hash string so you'll see uh one of the hash strings uh the initial H hash string is based on the remote Adder so this is going to be like your IP address essentially and then uh this is essentially saying uh we can also specify random and what random does is it will change our user ID so if I say question mark random equals true then I will be assigned like a different group right you see how like that's probably kind of nuts right you see how like because now that my user ID is essentially set at random and I'm not uh my logged out user ID is just a random number now and so I I'll get assigned a random group right but you see if I if I don't put random my IP address I always consistently get green and that's like kind of what you would expect so so let's kind of go over how to build out this experiment and I'm going to essentially make another version of this experiment so that y'all can um go ahead and start with me okay so this is uh you see if you made your account on stat Sig this is kind of like the stat Sig uh API or like the stat Sig UI that uh it's pretty cool um if we go in and you'll see over here on the left there's like a bunch of different options here there's like feature game experiments metrics all sorts of really cool stuff here I'm very happy that I integrated with stat but so if I go to experiments all right okay I'm going to show you first the experiment that I made and then I'm going to create a new one to show you how to make your own so you'll see in experiments here we have button color V2 and it's saying we're refreshing your pulse results okay whatever uh it's like taken a million years so uh you'll see we have have um so this this is the experiment so as you see like see this button color V2 the name here if you go look in the code base here you see this like uh line 40 here you see this like stat sig. experiment and then I pass it a stat Sig user and then I pass it button color V2 and then I want to get the attribute button color and then uh this is like the default value if for some reason the user can't be put into an experiment so let's go to set up real quick because I think that is probably a little bit confusing okay so what we are looking at here is initially this is how it works right so uh you you want to and yeah but you can't edit edit any of the parameters okay because once you start an experiment you can't edit any of these things it's like it's like set essentially so here's how it works right remember how I was talking about like okay what percent of users are going to be allocated to this experiment and then uh I say okay 100% so we're saying and then it's like 100% of what users so you can say like 100% of chrome users 100% of Android users that's interesting sorry I like to mess up about with things cool um so what are we going to do right we need to go to here's 100% of all users right and then you have to split you can uh and this is your split between all your groups and uh in this case I have four groups I have control is blue you have uh test is red or test one is red test two is green and test three is orange so that's those are the three tests and groups and this is essentially how this experiment works and um okay go back I want to get the attribute button color and then uh this is like the default value if for some reason the user can't be put into an experiment so let's go to setup real quick because I think that is probably a little bit confusing okay so what we are looking at here is initially this is how it works right so uh you you want to yeah but you can't edit edit any of the parameters okay because once you start an experiment you can't edit any of these things it's like it's like set okay Okay so parameter BT color that be string and then we have that red green orange blue \[Music\] essentially so here's how it works right remember how I was talking about like okay what percent of users are going to be allocated to this experiment and then uh I say okay 100% so we're saying and then it's like 100% of what users so you can say like 100% of chrome users 100% of Android users 100% of all users users right and then you have to split you can uh and this is your split between all your groups and uh in this case I have four groups I have control is blue you have uh test is red or test one is red test two is green and test three is orange so that's those are the three tests and groups and this is essentially how this experiment works and um and this will essentially go ahead and collect data and we'll have data here in this like pulse uh results some of this stuff we won't actually end up doing because this is like a local web server and we can't collect as much data but that's the whole point here as data Engineers my whole point here is I'm trying to teach y'all how experimentation Works underneath the hood so that you can like have a better appreciation for how things get split up so if we go back to the experiments tab here and uh what we want to do is we want to hit create we want to hit this blue create button and I'm going to call this button color uh let's going to call this button color V3 and then I'm going to say I think the red button the red button is is the best one all right and then uh this is where remember I was talking about like you can either use user ID or stable ID uh you can use either one here um I would say user ID because if you pick stable ID the problem is is like since it's local you're only going to get assigned one group and then you're done like and that's all that there's nothing else you can do about it but um if you pick stable ID then that's what and normally that's fine because like if you're a different user you'll be on a different device in a different location I should really learn to slow down and just follow the labs rather than trying to shoot ahead but like for us we want to have control over the user IDs so we're GNA hit create awesome so now we have our uh kind of experiment kind of set up um one of the other things you need to do is you want to think about the metrics that you could uh potentially be looking at right and so these are uh like there's a bunch of metrics that stattic gives you for free like uh daily active users l14 l28 all these are like very um kind of baked into the platform you'll see some of these like I have like user confirmed successful and sign up successful and visited sign up these are Uh custom events that I added into stat and uh I'm going to show you how you can we're going to log our own events as well so in this case what I want to look at is I want to look mostly at uh daily active users so you have to pick a metric here so what I'm saying is like I don't know I think that the red button is the best one and then you know the the null hypothesis in this case is that color doesn't impact things so then uh if we go down here you'll see we have our and originally it it breaks it out into see how it breaks it out into groups and then we have test and control and what I want to do is I want to add a parameter here and we're going to call this button color we're going to add so then uh control we're going to say is blue and test we're going to say is red and say we want more groups you can click this plus over here and then I can say green and I can get plus again and I can say orange and so now we have essentially uh an experiment that's going to run that is an even split 25 25 25 25 between blue red green and orange and we can see how that impacts our metrics the metric that we are caring about is daily active users obviously let's let's throw in another metric here uh let's say let's do um visited signup let's add that metric as well and so uh this is pretty much ready so what you want to do next here is you want to hit save always remember save like save always messes me up so now since we have defined our hypothesis right we have we have our primary metrics we're looking to track we are we have defined our groups and we can uh keep in mind each group can have its own parameters right I might add like U maybe I can add like paragraph text right and then I can be like uh you know data engineering boot camp and then here I can be like data engineering Okay so I'm just going to save this go to feature Gates conf oh that's really good I'm really glad thank you um I really appreciate that someone was like ear yeah but um but yeah I don't care I will do whatever I want so one thing I wanted to figure out was how did he add the custom metrics uh is it is there one in here okay I could add a metric okay so this is just exploring the metric it isn't creating metric \[Music\] okay metrix catalog yeah View for e e what I'm going to do is I'm not going to I'm going to discard that for now and I'm going to run the experiment and see what metadata gets back and then based on the metadata I will then change my value cool so yeah I will start that now in self-paced course and here I GNA be like data engineering uh I don't know Academy and here I can be like then I could also put like de um uh boot camp and because maybe people don't like to read all of it and they like the abbreviations but like you can see you can add whatever other uh parameters you want to each version of this so that you can imagine that I could swap out different titles with this or different paragraphs of things this way so I'm going to hit save here before we hit start so okay so now we have uh our our experiment is essentially ready to go uh the only other thing we need to do here is we want to hit start and then and then it's going to yell at us because uh you haven't tested your experiment in a non-production environment yet and um obviously you can you can do that if you want to test stuff uh I'm just going to hit launch though it's uh it's fine okay so we have launched great and so now what we want to do is let's go back into pie charm and on line 40 here we can change button color V2 just a button color V3 right and then I also want to get the uh I want to get the paragraph text or the title text call this title text I'm have to remove that thing again no it's called paragraph text right that's what I called it in the paragraph text and then this is um paragraph text then in here I'm just going to say data engineering boot camp and so uh now I have my paragraph text and I want to add this paragraph text just as um as another um HTML element here I'm going to put it here paragraph text I don't know if y'all have uh ever written some HTML just saying in the lab or in the homework for this week y'all are going to be doing some of this stuff so you'll see I switch to uh button color V3 and I have my data engineering boot camp as my um this is essentially the default if for some reason stats Sig can't put a user in to a group it will just use that paragraph text so now if we go back here and we refresh so you see now it's saying data engineering cell phace course right but I'm going to be forever in red because of this is my user identifier and now I'm in red forever but obviously if you throw on random equals true you can see how this will uh essentially swap like whatever group I'm in and so this is kind of the idea behind how this stuff works is you have um uh different groups and this assigns and then you have a different experience depending on the user that you are and the user that is kind of working with this stuff so how does this like so okay cool y'all are probably like wow Zack you made uh different colorful images show up in the lab today but it's like how does this make any difference in uh experiments like so well on one side we now are tracking daily active users so we will know whether or not someone's daily active just based on whether or not they hit this uh URL and then that's automatically logged in stat Sig um but we we need more right we need to see like okay if they go here do they actually visit another page so you saw how we had that uh we're tracking that other um metric you see this visited signup we probably want to track that metric as well so that's going to be the next thing that we want to do is we're going to add another metric into this another event that so that we can track that and we can see what happens as things kind of uh progress as we're adding more metrics and more engagement to this if we go back to pie charm one of the things is is what we want to do is you'll see there's a bunch of different routes and stuff for this API and you see this like Hello World route so you want to essentially copy lines 28 to 30 and then paste it again and then what you want to change here is this backs slash make it back slash signup so now this is going to be and then you want to change the string in here to be like this is the signup page so uh oh yeah sign up page we'll put it all one word there so so now what this is going to do is this going this is going to give us another web page on our server that we can look at so if we go here and then we essentially go to instead of back SL tasks we go to back signup you can't have you got to change this from Hello to sign up that's why because we have two functions with the same name so now now now flask won't be mad at us um okay so now it's working in Safari and I'm going to put that sign up route back because it was right so now um for some reason it wasn't working but now if we put s so to add a filter we have to go here here we have to go here give it the name that we want he said event count and user ID sa is it okay cool that's all we need to do actually so cool up here see now this is the signup page great but we probably want to put a route in the other page as well so um I don't know if y'all have ever done like so in this get tasks function you'll see this ends up rendering a lot of like HTML what I want you to do is at the bottom here we're just going to say um we're going to make an a tag and you want to use an hre here uh if yall have worked with h this is going to we're just going to say inside we're going to say go to sign up and then in the H here we're going to just put back SL signup and I'll show why we want to do this so um so that we can kind of have a a better time here so let's go back to tasks okay so you see uh wow blue is really hard to read okay but like you see down here this says like you see this like there's this go to sign up page that you can click and this this links back over to the sign up page kind of the basic sign up page so this is kind of the idea right okay green is way easier to read so then we can say go to sign up great now we are at this new sign up page and so this we want this action to be logged so that we can see like okay if people go to this tasks page how many of them click on this link and actually follow up so that's going to be our first thing that we want to do and the way that you do that is with um so stats has another um so we say like stats Sig and we got like there like log event and then in this case we have uh visited sign up and uh but we need to get our stat Sig user so in this case our stat Sig user is going to be based on um like it's going to be based on the same sort of Randomness or it's GNA be based on the same user ID from uh all of this stuff so uh if you copy the lines what 41 to 45 here this will give us our user ID that's going to be the hash and then then we have our stat Sig user stat Sig user is going to be stat Sig user user ID so now this will be our log stat Sig user and then you just have to pass him in here as kind of a that's that's right I'm pretty sure like so and then that will log the event for that specific stat Sig user so what we want to do is go back up to the server here and we need to import that uh so we can say from stat sig. stat Sig event import stat Sig event that's so lame that's the way you have to do it so in this case uh then we're going to have a stat Sig event in this case that's going to be a new stat event and then inside here there's going to be a user and that's going to be a user and then we have a event name that's going to be visited sign up and then this is and then you pass it in all together like that that's how it that's what it's expecting so this is going to be our kind of way that we're going to be adding more code into uh the sign up page and this will give us our event loging that we're looking for so now uh I'm pretty sure if I like hit hit sign up again there we go so now we're actually getting uh like actual event logging here that you would expect um so this is now we have our sign up page and then we have our task while to propagate right because we go to tasks okay we're in the orange group you go to sign up boom and then so now that is going to be a logged event so we should be able to see that actually if we go to button color V3 should be able to go to like Diagnostics okay there we go so you'll see in um stat Sig we have uh these are going to be all of the exposures of different users right and you'll see a lot of them were like those random users that I was implementing before with that um question random equals true so these are going to be all these users that were exposed to our um different kind of logging or to our different uh tests right so you see like okay this user got test two this one got control this one got test so you can get all sorts of different uh rules and uh splits that for users and you can see exactly how they're going to come in this way um and then if you go to the metrics tab one of the things that you should see here is oh there's going to also this is going to also have all of like my websites metrics in it too right yeah that's not it's not going to be there is is there one in here that's going to work does this have like metric lift at all okay okay I forget statti does take a little bit of time before you can actually see any of the um the actual metrics involved with stuff it takes like a little bit of time to like like log and show metrics so um that's kind of the idea behind how these metrics and these uh things are set up one of the things that's important to think about is when you're building out like apis and stuff like that is okay when is stuff logged and like so for example in this case one of the things that you might be uh that might be interesting here to y'all is that this is going to be logged on the server side as opposed to being logged like in the HTML because you could also put like an on click here you can put on click and then you can put like a function in here like bust out JavaScript in in python or whatever but like I don't recommend that but um that's like you could also potentially put the logging on the client side so that it happens before you even hit the signup page because that can be another way to uh kind of log stuff and so you can do client side logging and serers side logging and they have their different uh benefits and risks right so serers side logging is generally easier to set up like you saw how I set this up in like I don't know like five seconds um and so that is the great thing about serers side logging client side logging is a little bit trickier um yeah it's doing that so it should work okay logs are available for build cing after 30 minutes so it's going to take some time because of the fact that uh we don't want like and here's the problem with client side logging is we don't want to give uh random clients the ability to just log whatever they want to our servers so you have to do this thing called like ooth like uh ooth like um authorization with your client which like is a little bit more complicated uh but the thing is is like you also get better Fidelity data that way because you get the you get the event when they clicked and like when they did the action in the client not when the server picked it up so like you actually get like better events and higher quality events and like you also can get things like scroll time and like uh view time and like I know at Facebook they have this this notion of this thing called time spent which is like how long someone is spending in the feed and that could be another uh powerful thing for people to work with uh and that time spent is mostly a client side uh logging kind of mechanism and all those metrics can be very important for experimentation as well so this is kind of the idea right is you want to set up uh your servers to do both and generally speaking you want to start with doing uh server side logging because it's like it's just easier just so much easier and then uh after a while what you can do is you can set up other sort of things right so one of the things I don't know if y'all saw but if go to like Zack wilson. Tech and um I'm currently running an experiment here on this sign up button so this sign up button uh for some people is red and for some people it's blue depending on uh like who you are it's the way I have it set up right now is it's 80% red 20% blue and so that's just uh something to to see and uh definitely know that that's like a thing that's happening but uh let me show you how that works because for that experiment like I actually didn't use I didn't run an experiment with it what I did was I used what's called a feature gate so there's a couple differences there um feature gate one of the big things about it is like you don't get groups you only get a yes or a no and in this case I have like red or blue which is also just if you have two outcomes then like you can use a feature gate as well and feature Gates can sometimes be uh simpler to work with than experiments because feature Gates don't have like you'll see like when you're in this feature gate page you'll see there's no like make a decision and you can also edit things like as whenever you want whereas experiments like are a little bit more like controlled where you have to just like they have to be fixed at a certain time but feature gates are awesome especially like you know how I was talking about those long-term holdouts of like people who don't receive notifications on Facebook or different sort of things like that so what you get in this case is this is going to be my uh kind of homepage show new homepage which it's just filtering that that button right so you see the split here so we have like 80% uh means that 80% gets red and 20% gets blue and obviously I can change this I can make this 50% if I wanted to and then that's not going to that's going to just that's going to be fine and that will like and it will just it will just change the environment of the thing but the idea behind this is you can also kind of do longer term experiments here so let me let me show you what I mean by like okay so here's my uh here's the results so I set this up like two days ago I think yeah August 11th I set this up on like on it was like more on Saturday but so in that time in the last two days there's been uh like 2700 people who have like been part of this experiment uh in the last like two two two three days and we don't have Monday's data yet but uh you'll see like it's keeping that nice like 8020 split like so what that means is 2200 people have seen the red button and 500 people have seen the blue button and it's keeping that nice 8020 split that we're expecting um so this is where you get more data behind like statistical significance so one of the things you'll notice here is um for our 90% confidence interval you'll see that like every single bar overlaps zero so if any of these bars overlap zero what that means is like the effect could be negative or positive like we don't know and so uh that's like kind of uh like frustrating but like what what essentially that means from this experiment so far is that it doesn't matter that much right red versus red button versus Blue Button does not matter that much but you'll see like I can go in here and I can edit this confidence interval so let me show you like what the difference here is let's go to 80% confidence interval and you'll see okay with the 80% confidence interval now we have a statistically significant result we have this guy here uh this uh visited sign up but um because its P value is17 and that's less than 0.2 uh but like most data scientists might look at this and be like I don't know if I can trust that because there still is like almost a 20% chance that this could be random and so that's a thing to remember when you're like interpreting these results is that the the confidence interval matters quite a bit and so generally speaking you want it to be set to uh 95 so you see how this is like Alpha equals .2 Alpha equals 05 that's essentially the prob Alpha is the probability that you're wrong the probability that you are saying that this is not a coincidence when it actually is a coincidence and that's where uh the the the 95% confidence interval generally speaking is the better play but one of the things that uh I want to show as well though is these things aren't necessarily uh just you can look at things more specific right so for example this one this like so you see this is a not this is that visited sign up not a stat a statistically significant result and you'll see like if you group it by different countries like you see Canada Great Britain India they're all not statistically significant but if we drop this to 80% the only reason I'm doing this is to show y'all like kind of uh how things can be different here though but you see okay so now this experiment that like is statistically significant overall it's actually not statistically significant in India and it's not significant statistically significant in Great Britain but apparently the US and Canada they just freaking love they just the US in particular really loves like red buttons right this is almost like you almost can get you can almost use 0. n as your uh confidence interval like a 90% confidence interval for the us but you'll notice that like for India and Great Britain like the color really does not matter and so uh that's one of the things to think about when you are also running your statistical tests is is there actually an underlying population where things might be different where things might be like for example maybe I run a test where instead of putting my prices in dollars I put my prices in INR and if I put my prices in INR like I would imagine uh it would hurt the us and it would help India so like that's a just you know an obvious like duh sort of example that would have a like of an experiment that would have a very strong impact on like a a certain slice of your users and in probably a detrimental Slice on another set of users and so that's a thing to think about when you're like building out this kind of stuff is when you're running experiments like you might not get like a but it'd be interesting to see like if like um you can do a a experiment to see whether or not like um I just want it be interesting to see whether or not you can do an experiment to see whether or not um the like changing it to the country's local currency would make a difference hi jar thanks for the video just wanted to know will your Channel videos be still available um I going to and I start boot camp l I honestly don't know I'm I'm still waiting on Zach to to get back to me but basically the kind of rule will be if he ask me to take them down then I'll take them down basically clean thing where it's like okay yeah overall we get a bump but like for some users it might be a drop and for other users it might be a gain it's not always like a a clean and cut like everybody wins and it's always a better exper exp experience for everybody so that's another thing to think about when you're kind of like building out different things so that's what so feature gates are really powerful in that way and uh and they can do some really some really good stuff one of the things that I I I just wanted to kind of end with here with experimentation is that experiments are going to be one of the most important ways to have impact as a data engineer and It's tricky because of the fact that when you are doing experimentation and setting stuff up and like getting this far where you end up having these like actual Pages where you can look at stuff is like it's very far removed from the actual data engineering jop and like that's one of the things that like I think will change in some regards and I'm hoping that some of y'all you pick the analytics track and I'm I'm my uh understanding is that some of y'all that pick the analytics track actually your goal might be to be more of like an analytics engineer or a data scientist or like another kind of role like that and that's where like having this knowledge can be very useful but they can be very useful for data Engineers as well because it's like okay what metrics like what other numbers do we need in these charts like this so that uh data scientists can have a clearer picture of their experiments so like that's one of the big things that they do in big Tech right so this is one of the things that Airbnb is kind of like uh like leading the way on is they have this thing called manura which is like a metric repository of all the metrics that like Airbnb could care about and then in and so then in an experiment you can have all these metrics and one of the things that uh you can do with some of these metrics so if I go to metrics and let me go to like visited sign up so if I go into this metc here and I go to um set up here uh should be a because it takes 30 minutes to propagate and I'm not going to stay on for another 30 minutes because it's bedtime wait isn't there a way to do it you can't do it in here oh that's lame okay well anyways uh most metrics have a way of being what's called uh is it metric catalog go here I think this is where it is okay so you can catalog metrics and I think in here you can add manage tags there we go there we go so like in here you can create a new tag and then we can say like guard rail right so um these are all the metrics that should never go down right okay so now I have my tags and uh I have this tag for guardrail and now that will be what we can use for our different metrics cataloges and you'll see now if I add that to here it can be like guard rail metric and then I can add another guard rail metric so what guardrail metrics do is they are metrics that are so important to the business that like if uh if an experiment causes these numbers to go down that experiment is essentially blocked from deploying um for example uh at uh at Airbnb uh uh the guard rail metric that I worked on was reservation profitability so it's like if we have an experiment that significantly drops uh profitability then that experiment probably is not going to launch but that's not uh like that's a that's a no-o right and so that's where and that is where um data Engineers can actually have a very important impact and play a very important role in experimentation is if your company has the notion of guardrail metric that metric can be owned essentially by you as a data engineer or an analytics engineer and that is it's essentially a way to prevent data scientists and product Managers from like going too wild and doing all sorts of crazy because like you don't want them to do that right because if they are doing crazy stuff like like that's going to hurt the business and it's going to hurt these metrics and so and you don't want them to do that like that's not like a that's not it's not a solid way to to to go about doing stuff you know and so I I would recommend in those cases to uh like really invest in quality because that was one of the things that was the problem with uh like with guard with guard rail metrics when you create them they have to be very high quality right you can't have crazy quality bugs in your guardo metrics because like they're going to stop experiments right they have to be very trusted so like they're gonna they have to have very high quality they also have to be very fresh because you can't have like your guardrail data being behind where where you have your data scientists who needed to determine do I do I launch this experiment do I not launch this experiment right you have to do that as well and like if you do that like okay like how do you have like a a regularly refreshing uh metric that is a guardrail metric that people can use that will then prevent them from launching bad experiments and making bad decisions and that's where I I'm hoping that between like weeks three when we were talking a lot about um uh data quality and talking about like how to have high high high data quality using things like write audit publish and then in week four we're talking about like analytical patterns where you have those State change patterns those State change patterns are very often guard rail metrics where you don't have you don't want to have too many users churning you also don't want to have too many users who are uh like stale or like too many or too many fake accounts that are coming in right there could be all sorts of different uh things that can happen that can make guardrail metrics uh very important for launching experiments so that's the kind of the last thing I wanted to talk about at least in this kind of UI and how you can kind of catalog these different metrics into different buckets of things congrats on getting to the end of the day one lab if you're taking this class for credit make sure to switch over to the other tab so you can get credit for the day two lecture leading and lagging metrics so that's it um for for the kpis and experimentation I'm nearly done I think let me see how many lessons I've got left um yes I've Got Dat visualization which will be next week's job and then I've got data maintenance which is the week after so and then I'm done I'm so close so close um let's see where I am the dashboard now yeah two hours and seven minutes to go that doesn't seem right um how does that work then if if 40 60 1 Hour 1 hour 45 for that and there's over two hours for that yeah how does that work then I don't know I do not know all I know is that's a long ass lecture like look into how does this work like so much of the other kind of pieces of the puzzle so we going go create a new Doc here and then uh call this why would you have a l for like one minute how odd maybe it's just it it says one minute but it's like four minutes that's a bit odd oh well right cool so my aim is to get this completed by the end of the month so I've got two weeks now to get this completed by the end January end of January we can do this thank you for watching everyone and yeah I will see you tomorrow because I'll be back same time tomorrow doing the homework so yeah thank you for especially you Kier and you stayed for for pretty much the full thing and it's been nice talking to you so thank you for staying and I'll see you maybe again uh yeah

> - **Leading vs. Lagging Metrics (3:26):** Almost every metric should correlate with money (increasing revenue or decreasing cost).
> - **Revenue as a Lagging Metric (3:40):** Revenue is slow-moving; data engineering should link to money by increasing revenue or decreasing costs.
> - **Leading Metrics Examples (4:06):** Optimizing pipelines (meta data optimization) or improving customer service efficiency (cost reduction).
> - **Non-Profit Metric Exception (7:05):** Nonprofits may focus on lives saved, people helped, or environmental impact, but cost efficiency is still important.
> - **Leading vs. Lagging Metrics Defined (8:42):** Leading metrics are inputs, and lagging metrics are outputs.
> - **Website Funnel Example (9:37):** Visits -> Signups -> Purchases. Conversion rate is the key correlation.
> - **Personal Application of Metrics (14:53):** Apply leading/lagging metrics to personal goals like job searching (e.g., hours of SQL practice vs. jobs received).
> - **Networking Importance (23:24):** Build a network for opportunities; don't rely solely on coding skills.
> - **Applying to Jobs (26:53):** Don't only apply to jobs where you meet all the requirements.
> - **Interview Strategy (29:00):** Evaluate the company and hiring manager; ask critical questions about job expectations and management style.
> - **Value of Mentorship (1:17:38):** Mentorship is as valuable as knowledge; it provides guidance and connections.
> - **Building a Sustainable Business (1:30:05):** Change lives and inspire others to build.
> - **Product Analytics Funnel (40:56):** Impressions -> Web Page Visits -> Sign Ups -> Product View -> Purchase -> Product Use -> Testimonial. Analyze drop-offs at each stage.
> - **Importance of Tracking (46:17):** Track where people are coming from (referrer) to optimize channels. 
> - **AB Testing (53:05):** Responsiveness, page speed and Button Color are important to test on landing pages.
> - **Incentivize Actions (1:16:07):** Encourage people to do homework by making Q&A exclusive.
> - **Need to impact their life in a way more than just giving them knowledge** (1:17:27)
> - **Impact over Money (37:38):** Focus on impact not just money.
