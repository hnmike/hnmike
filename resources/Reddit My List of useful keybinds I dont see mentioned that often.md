> First one changes \[count\] words (the part before the `ciw` ignores and modifies the count given so that we actually select \[count\] words since `iw` counts whitespace around a word as a separate word), second one deletes \[count\] words and whitespace around it. The third one is just so that I have access to the original behavior of `X` (I don't need to make a mapping to `S` since `cc` already does the same thing).
