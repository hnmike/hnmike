## Cathay – A Global Premium Airline and Lifestyle Brand

Founded in **1946 in Hong Kong**, Cathay Pacific started as a regional airline and grew into a **global premium carrier**, connecting Asia with the world. Over decades, it expanded long-haul routes, acquired **Dragonair**, and became a **major player in international aviation**.

Now, Cathay is undergoing a **strategic transformation** beyond just aviation. The company has **rebranded as ‘Cathay’**, introducing a **premium travel master brand** that integrates flights, holidays, shopping, dining, wellness, and payments. All unified under the Asia Miles loyalty programme. While **Cathay Pacific remains the airline brand**, ‘Cathay’ now represents a **holistic approach to premium travel experiences**.

CEO Ronald Lam emphasized that **modern travelers seek more than just transportation—they seek seamless and personalized experiences**. This evolution reflects Cathay’s 77-year journey and renewed commitment to **customer-centric innovation**.

### The Future of Travel with Real-Time Data Streaming

To power this transformation, Cathay is **leveraging real-time data streaming** to enable:

✅ **Personalized customer experiences** to offer tailored holiday packages and rewards.

✅ **Seamless digital integration** to allow customers to **book, shop, and earn rewards effortlessly**.

✅ **Smarter operations** to optimize airline logistics, inventory, and real-time customer engagement.

Cathay’s first global campaign in three years, **‘Feels Good To Move’**, embodies this shift—redefining premium travel as an integrated lifestyle. By harnessing **data-driven intelligence and real-time streaming technologies**, Cathay is **shaping the future of travel**, offering a **truly connected, customer-first experience**.

## Why Cathay Pacific Moved from Traditional Middleware to Data Streaming with Apache Kafka

Like many enterprises, Cathay Pacific previously relied on **traditional middleware** using APIs, file transfers, and message queues (MQ). While these technologies worked well for certain integrations, they often **lacked real-time capabilities** and **couldn’t scale efficiently** to support the airline’s expanding digital services.

### Why Apache Kafka?

1. **Industry Standard for Data Streaming**:
- Kafka is the [**de facto standard for real-time event streaming**](https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2021/05/09/kafka-api-de-facto-standard-event-streaming-like-amazon-s3-object-storage/), widely adopted across industries.
- Many **off-the-shelf SaaS solutions** integrate seamlessly with Kafka (see the [data streaming landscape](https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2024/12/04/the-data-streaming-landscape-2025/) for more details).
2. **Seamless SaaS Integration**:
- As Cathay expanded its ecosystem, integrating with cloud-based services like AWS, payment platforms, and booking engines **became essential**.
- Kafka’s widespread support made integration with **third-party travel and retail solutions much easier**.

### Why a Cloud-Native SaaS for Data Streaming?

Migrating to serverless **Confluent Cloud** was a **strategic decision** that accelerated Cathay’s ability to innovate.

✅ **Security and Compliance**: Private Link ensures **secure, direct connectivity** between cloud services.

✅ **Managed Connectors**: Prebuilt **AWS S3 and Lambda connectors** reduced integration time and effort.

✅ **Faster Time to Market**: Fully managed **Kafka infrastructure eliminated operational overhead**, letting engineers focus on building **new customer experiences**.

✅ **Schema Registry for Data Governance**: Standardized schemas ensure **data quality and consistency**, preventing errors when streaming data across multiple systems.

## Driving the Business Value with Data Streaming

Cathay Pacific has embraced **real-time event streaming** to **connect legacy systems, cloud services, and business applications** across its expanding ecosystem.

#### Real-Time Analytics for a Personalized Customer Experience

By combining **booking data, shopping transactions, and loyalty program activity**, Cathay can generate **real-time customer insights** to:

🔹 **Optimize in-flight services** based on customer preferences.  
🔹 **Offer personalized promotions** while customers shop via Cathay’s retail channels.  
🔹 **Improve demand forecasting** for better inventory and pricing decisions.

With Kafka-powered real-time analytics, **business teams can instantly access and act on data**—no need to wait for batch ETL jobs.

#### Empowering Business Users with a Self-Service Data Catalog

To make real-time data easily accessible across departments, Cathay has built an **internal data catalog** using Kafka streams.

✅ **Business users can discover and access real-time datasets** without needing IT intervention.  
✅ **Faster innovation** as teams can **combine different data sources** (e.g., booking & shopping data) to create **new customer engagement strategies**.

#### Moving from Batch Processing to Streaming

Cathay is gradually **phasing out traditional batch ETL pipelines** in favor of **event-driven architectures**:

🚀 **Replacing legacy file-based processing and MQ systems** with **real-time Kafka streaming**.  
🚀 **Exploring Apache Flink for real-time stream processing**, enabling advanced data transformations.  
🚀 **Reducing reliance on Informatica**, whose batch ETL approach and clunky connectors **limit real-time capabilities**.

The long-term vision? **A unified event streaming platform** where **all operational data flows in real time**.

## Data Streaming: The Foundation for Cathay’s Future Growth

As Cathay Pacific continues its digital transformation, real-time data streaming will be essential in supporting **new services and revenue streams** beyond air travel.

By leveraging Apache Kafka and its ecosystem in Confluent Cloud, Cathay has turned its data into a strategic asset, enabling:

🔹 **Seamless integration between cloud-native and legacy applications**  
🔹 **Faster time to market for new customer experiences**  
🔹 **A scalable, event-driven infrastructure for future innovations**

The transition from a traditional airline to a **full-scale travel & retail ecosystem** requires **real-time, scalable, and flexible data infrastructure**.

With Confluent Cloud, Cathay has built a **central integration platform** where data is treated as a product—**accessible, trustworthy, and reusable** across the organization.

As Cathay expands its partner ecosystem, introduces AI-driven personalization, and enhances loyalty programs, its investment in data streaming will be critical to unlocking new business opportunities.

**Cathay is proving that in today’s digital world, an airline is much more than just flights—it’s an integrated travel experience, powered by real-time data.** 🚀
