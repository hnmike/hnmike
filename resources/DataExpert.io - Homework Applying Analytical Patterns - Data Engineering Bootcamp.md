> e e e for so we need to do state tracking players for when they're new when they're retired when they continued playing and return from the retirement for for okay so these are the different rules that we need to follow thank you hey that's good to know that it worked thank you for letting me know okay so these are the different scenarios e continue play turn turn okay so those are the different rules that we need to think about and so so these are the different scenarios that we need to think about so when it's new it's never existed when the play Never exed before uh retired when the player played last season but hasn't played this season when the player continued playing from last season it's also playing this season when the player did not play last season but has played this season and then when they've stay retired they've not played last season and they've not played this season so those are the three there's are the five key scenarios that we to about so let's do that so first of all what we need to do is uh we need to for e so I'm just looking at the different tables here um so so I think we don't need to use the players table for this one um I actually think it's players season um so we got the player name got the season and then we're going to basically why are you on here hi I haven't started the paid boot camp to be honest I've been focusing on getting this done first and then once this is done then I'll start doing the paid boot camp stuff but to be honest I've not really had a chance to have a look at much of it to be fair but I'm not too bothered because I am I yeah unfortunately I can't really like um do do the um do the lives because they're like 2 am in the UK so everything's going to have to be catch up anyway but I'm not too bothered about that because I I know that I'm not going to complete it in in time scales of what they probably want anyway so I'm just going to do it in a time scale that I feel like is is manageable for me and for me it's not about finishing like it's not about finishing it's about getting getting it like done like when I need to really okay so I think I'm going to use the player Seasons Table because what I can do is I can go on a yearly basis then and I can start with a year and then I can ccate okay well let's compare that year with the previous year and so I'm going to create a new table um called that's what the thing said I'm going to say I'm call that for e e don't think I need to do um an arrow potentially could do an arrow I guess of views where they're active and where they're not active guess I could do that I shall I shall do that why not why not yeah so let's do as well as that we can do first active let's do that now let's do that now keep it simple let's just do that and then your primary key is oh thank you that I really appreciate that and oh lovely what's the book about okay so that's created what can I do I can do a select yesterday from my worth accounting so yeah let's do that okay so let's do with yesterday as e e e e yeah I see the name um jade as a name for a lot of like restaurants and stuff because it's representative of the Jade stone so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get like the different variables I need from the uh the player season table for e e e oh no see you have a nice time okay so thank you goodbye okay so the next thing we've done is we've done a work Claw on the next date um and then what we're going to do is I'm just going to do something kind of player e I don't think there can be um for a a season let me just check something yeah know that's fine Playa in a season can't be it's Unique so we don't need to worry about like di duplicates oh so that's fine we can we can just do that and then we can do uh let's do star fast e and so now I'm just um creating the query to add these rules basically e e Okay so we've got our player name we've got our Cent Year got our first of year we've got our first our last set of year so up to here now don't to do the these bits here so use active should be quite simple this is just doing a case by um so uh based on that I think to what we did very very similar to what we did in um in the previous one no that was it will be a e that I'm just um writing the query out now for for um this hi car how you doing active and then and then Okay so we've done that one now the last one to do is to do the actual like difficult bit which is this bit here okay so what we can do is you can do Cas uh do when um and when just trying to think of this okay so when okay so we got wi up play is nor than you when for okay I think I know what I need to do now so I'm just trying to figure out sorry Hi kilan how are you doing I'm glad you finally got your ASD diagnosis how was it it was it was intense to be fair it was a lot more intense than I thought it was going to be um and there was a lot of things it that didn't really realize that I did that um that apparently I very very common with people who have autism but like for example um one of the things that really threw me and I still don't really like it's still FR me is apparently that like most people like feel their emotions like in their body um like they physically feel like feelings in their body when they feel sad or when they feel angry or when they feel happy and I just couldn't relate to that at all and like they kept asking me questions like oh how do you feel when like you know you're you're you know you're happy and I'm like my brain feels happy and or how do you feel when you're sad and I was like my brain feels sad and it's was like you know and and but apparently people feel like you know like they feel like body tend to up or they feel like um the heart rate go up or they feel like unwell and I thought that was a really really weird thing to try and um grasp in my brain I couldn't I can't and still can't grass it like I talking to my partner about it and how he actually feels the emotions in his body and yeah that that was just a weird like Revelation to me that people do that the other thing that I found really interesting um which I only really realized afterwards was they kept asking me um they kept asking me like to look at fots and to look at a story and to and to like document what was happening in the pictures and in in the story and everything I talked about was very very like factual of this is what is happening you know that there's some frogs doing some actions um there's a result and there's like like a play there's you know like lots of different things and um and I just talked about the things rather than the people there was a lot of people in the pictures but I didn't talk about anything about like the um the emotions of people and I I didn't realize like until Afters where she was like you know that's quite an uncommon thing for someone who who is neurotypical like because most people focus on like the people and the emotions of those people but you entirely just focused on what was actually actually happening which was another weird thing and then I thought about like um one of the questions that I never understood in uh the the like assessment was they FOC like there was a question I got asked in one of the like you know pre-screening questions and it was like oh they focus more on objects than on people and I never knew what that meant never knew what that meant until yesterday now I know what that means from after doing those two things I I Now understand what that means so yeah that was that was a really weird sentation um e e e okay so this is slightly uh wrong um what I need to do is e e it's notal okay so what I'm saying here is if when play play name is no um so the current year is no and for the last year they don't equal the same as last active that they've been stayed retired because last year they wasn't retired they didn't play and this year they didn't play otherwise um they're retired and then yeah that should be the uh that should be everything I think um I think that's that should be everything then we need to end it okay so yeah these are all going to be new that's absolutely fine that's what we would expect what I'll do is I'll do an insert it's out of curiosity caros then what was it that like made you like you you've mentioned it a while but thought I was um that I had ASD what was it that like really stood out to cool let's let's try that now let's have a that looks pretty right to me I think you can have both in the UK um so you can be diagnosed with both in the UK okay so that looks right I think I'm pretty happy with that um so that is good you say that but like um one of the things that uh you you don't know a lot about my childhood and I love my parents but they were quite neglectful in some ways um so there's a lot of things that um that they did what I would say is very very like ADHD like traits um and so and so that's one of the biggest reasons why I think um this is still the ADHD there um and I know a lot of people who haven't been diagnosed until they adults mostly women because it's much harder for women to um get diagnosed especially in the UK not it's it's not as easy in the UK to get a diagnosis for things like this as in other countries you can't just go to a GP and easily get a diagnosis it's quite an Ord deal so um so it's not it's not as clearcut is that you had been diagnosed as a child because for women it's just not that's just not true Okay so we've done the first one this is the so we've done this one that the next one yeah we'll see anyway um we'll see we'll see because um I do I do still have a waiting assessment for ADHD and the woman in my ASD assessment did say um we can see that you've been referred for adg as well we believe that that is a valid assessment for you to go for because typically people with ADH with ASD apparently like if it's just ASD they really struggle with um with having strict routines they need to have strict routines whereas people who have like a combination tend to find that like some of the ADHD traits can can kind of mass or like counteract some of the ADHD trait ASD traits and so like for me like I do not struggle with routine like I like to have a routine but I don't need to like be at specific times I don't need to go to a specific place at a specific time and I don't need to like um have my day like planned out to the ninth degree um whereas like if someone was just autistic she this is what the woman said anyway she said that they would typically um need that structure okay e e um I'm happy for to know your reasoning um probably not like but like I said I'm not too if I don't have it then I don't have it and that's absolutely fine um I I went for both because I believed like like when I filled the sheeting and stuff like that like the the other one the ADHD one felt a lot more like me um even though they were both like me the ADHD one more like me makes sense um but yeah it was it was it was weird like um like one of the things I'm really bad at like is is is uh remembering to do stuff I have to set times all the time else I'll just forget about doing stuff and my parents were really really bad for that like um like there were a lot of times where we'd have to like redo and redo the washing machine just because they would forget about it and um and the clothes would then go all smelly and um all like they sit in the dryer really wet for days and stuff like that and I just remember like that that being quite a lot of my childhood um so I don't that was one of the things like um that was one of the things that really made me maybe is this the other one um rather than ASD I I really didn't know like the ASD one I I didn't I didn't think it was ASD for like um for for a while like I didn't really understand that but then like when I had the call with the woman yesterday like and everything that she was going through it just kind of it all made a lot more sense I guess um but I think you don't need to um you don't need to take stimulants if you have a diagnosis like they don't force you to do any of that it's more like um therapies and stuff that you get this to a l the time let's have a look at what is in games details table so set want to aggregate data set on the following dimensions on team okay ni thank you for your message Carlo and and I'll see you soon goodbye Okay so we want to do an aggregation on team ID and player ID the play name okay so I'm just going to comment this out and then I'm going to create a uh the new table I'll do this okay e e e do e e oh wait one second this is wrong um Sun okay hi Jesse uh how you doing Ed yes I am doing the boot camp just the um just the live one the paid one at the moment though no I'm doing the free one at the moment I have paid for the paid one but I'm just trying to get through this at the first P all I need to um create a couple of CTS I think okay I'm go do e I do think I'm going to have to join the game and the the um games details together because I need the season and I need the point okay that's fine thank you Eduardo and I hope you're doing well and yeah good luck with the good luck with the pre one I hope you manag to get through in time e e I am pretty sure like the games and games details should be a onetoone relationship but if not I'm just going to do left join because you should always have a game but maybe you don't always have the game details set I don't to all I want to select it makes it really hard because these mean absolutely nothing to me as someone from the UK these values mean to me I'm assuming this mean points and that's all I'm going on other than that nothing means nothing to me e hello I haven't actually done any of the paid Bo poop camp yet just because I find it really difficult to do this and then at the same time when they're completely different um parts of the boot camp at the moment um so I'm focusing on getting this over with at the moment and then I'll go to boot camp later on I'm thinking of maybe like making like booking a couple of days off here and there as well to try and get this line because there's quite a lot of content in even just the paid the free one um so yeah think it is needed for e for EX e e e e right I think it's something like that I'm do I'm going set hold it now what I'm going to do is that doesn't it e let's do that what I want to do is I want to validate that that sum is correct and it is so that's good look like it's correct which is good um yeah no I think that's good uh I think that's gives us what games I played so let me just do just remove this one for now oh you know I'm not selected I'm not put season in there silly okay so what I can do now is see um let's just do I want to do the same thing again what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do with this Trevor guy who's this Trevor guy in Season 2020 2020 these is just me validating what I'm writing is correct by the way so appears to be correct okay and so then we can do so it's always good likey make a few small queries to validate your big query I think1 37 there we go it's it's working this is what we want to see okay so the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do that for team so for team ID do it on team so 1172 361 5 3 772 and 6532 yay it's all working as I expected it to all the numbers are coming out like I want them to it is good that is a good thing cool so what we've done is we created an argumented um set of of of dat so we' got a game ID we've got a season we got a player name we got a team ID and we got our points and then we do a join from games and game details because game has the information about the season and games detail has the information about the player name the team ID and the points um and we join them together on game ID we then do uh grouping on we do a uh grouping grouping set on the so we have uh we do a grouping on player name and team ID we do a grouping on player name and season we do a grouping on team ID and we set the aggregation level um and then we say if um we then get the aggregation level basically based on whether or not these values are set if they are then we know that the um the values is play a team or play a season Etc um so so this logic is basically the logic that go coincides with this um and then what we do is then we do the play name the teaming of the season and then what we can do from that is we can then get the games played because the games played is the count the amount of entries for that that that grouping and then we can get the Su of the points as well of Point as points played let's call that total points instead that let's call Total so that's the second qu the last one is uh the a query that uses window functions games details to find out the following things what is the most games a team has woron in a 90day stretch I'm quer that uses window functions and games dets things game stretch how many games in a row did LeBron score over 10 points again I know sometimes it can look like I'm not doing anything but I am I'm thinking that that is a dangerous thing but it is happening I'm not just like you know doing nothing just just thinking e e teet LeBron James SC feel like we can do another window function here oh I think we can do another drawing function here like that for this one I'm just going to write the query that that I would write just to see that data and then we can figure out a way to create a single window function to the other thing I need is date as well for so I'm just going to now I've ordered it by date I don't know what this means by how many games in a row did Le score over 10 points a game because does that mean like how many of Max Games do you do in a row I assume that means Max just gonna ask like chat G like e e e TBT would assume that is the case okay um those a home team wind here so I'm wondering if that's the thing that we need to use for this to say okay well um for yeah there is sorry um I'm just trying to um think about the last question so the last question is the let's go back we've got a query that uses windows and games details to find the following things what who what is the most games the team has won in a 19 game so I am trying to find that information so it feels like the first thing that we need to do is find out the amount of games that teams have won um so I'm figuring out what the best way is to find information out um I think the best way to find information out is from the games so look in here sorry can you barely hear me um is that better hello I don't want to talk turn it up too much louder Just because when I turn it up louder then it goes into like the Red Zone and then um people can find the audio quite quickly um yeah that's it's hard to say because I think a few people have have watched and they've not had an issue so I'm not sure if there's other than turning my makeup and increasing the gain there's not much more I can do I don't think um let me try listening on my yeah I can hear it on the phone um I can try to is that better that one um I'm just seeing if there's a way that I can turn it up a little bit louder \[Music\] hello um okay is is this turning up at all or is it just the same still is it too loud or is it better like now uh better I'm just trying to get it to a point where it's loud enough let's let's take that to 15 is that is oh that's getting a bit into the yellow I don't want to do that what about that is that okay cool um let me just check on my phone as well just make sure that that's sounds okay so you might is that okay cool um let me just check on my phone as well just make sure cool awesome good sorry about that it's it's so so like um the audio can be a bit pickle like it and and it needs like different settings for like when I'm doing filming versus when I'm doing streaming and like it looks green everything's green on on my audio mixer and it it looks like it's the right volume but then um then it has a meltdown like clearly cool right um so yeah so I think what we need to do is we need to do a comparison um we've got a h team ID and we've got a team visit team ID for for what we're going to do is from this you can then um determine determine which team's going to be the winner e I'm just trying to think of what what what function like Zach would particularly want I guess you've got \[Music\] um just going to go back to chat GT again and say um hello the um okay so what is we doing so we've got all games which is we're selecting all of this so basically uh we are in the last um question and the last question is to get the most games a team has won on in a 90 g game stretch and so um we need to find out what the most games is for a specific team and get the top the maximum one basically so you can kind of see like um you've got you we um so so what we're doing is we're doing a select buy to get the um the these are the following following things that we want so we need to know the game um we need to know the date um because we need to know the order of the games that were played we need to know the game ID we need to know the season and we well I don't think we need to know the season The Season's not important actually \[Music\] um and then what we're doing here is for each team we're saying whether or not they won or they lost yeah no this isn't leak Cod this is um this isn't leak Cod this is um this is the sax data engineering boot camp so if you go into the like description there's some details about the um the the boot camp and yeah so so so it's been pretty good to be fair um I've learned a lot okay so this yeah so so this is the the first thing it does is we get the yes that's correct um telling wins by teams and displaying the most wins yep that's correct so the first thing we need to do is we need to get the um whether or not the team of the home team have won or whether or not the visitor team have won and and then we can do a unit in all to get the full list of whether or not a team have won or lost and then when we've done that we can then get the um like rolling win CU we can order by the um game date and we can get like uh the like wins over a night game period which is what this bit's doing and then from that you can then select the maximum win in 9 games for each team let's do this first so let's do that so we can see that team ID team with ID 61061 2744 have the max wins in a 90 game stretch then we can limit by one to get that one I'm just going to move that to yeah and similarly for um this one I think we need to do a we first need to join the game date table and the this table and we order by date and then we can do something very similar to this where we um some the point instead of suming the Winds we can sum the points um and select the maximum of that again no that's not correct um because this is going to be slightly different uh because it's not over a 10 row period it'll be if the current row is less than 10 then or if the current point is less than 10 then you need to it you need to go to the like next row and figure out what the the best the best um aage is going to be what did um say actually okay so let's do this um so Chi said a good thing to do would be to do the game date um the the game date that we said the game ID the player name and the points and then what we can do is when the points is over 10 we have um a column which says over 10 points and then we can do a row number over partition play name and then we ought to by the the date minusing um the um let's just see what this actually produces oh nice so yeah this can then will then um I my play name and then e two three four five 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 okay so yeah when when it gets to zero it then resets it back to um the previous values is now the the current Street group um no that's not correct all right okay that doesn't matter actually because um because then what what we're doing is every time so every time like this gets set this is zero and then it's now one and then two so because we're going to do a group by the street group it doesn't matter that um about this number here for some reason it how does that work then so just say we've got um play name bu so yeah is 37- z and that's why it ends up in I see your software engineer are you transition into a new career I just expanding your skill set so I'm just expanding my skill set because basically I need to do data engineering as part as my will for a little bit so um so hopefully by doing this I'll I'll be able to do a lot more is part of my world because in my department I we don't have like a distinction between software engineers and dat Engineers we just are everyone's like a software engineer and if you want to go into more data focused areas you can do so do that that seems like it does what we want I'm just going to um yeah cool so one thing I'm going to do is just going to uncom this side this um cool so I think that's pretty much everything I'm going to add a few comments here but that should be ready to submit um I'm going to end here though because it's quite late now and I'm I'm a little bit tired tonight it's been a really long day but thank you for those who have tuned in I hope this was useful um yeah uh I think for it was really useful using chat DBT for the last two it was just figuring out what columns you need to use once you figured out the columns that you need to use you can work with chat um to help you figure out the appropriate like methods that you want for that I found that quite useful um just make sure that when you use chat that you actually go through it you look at the data you look at what it's doing why it's doing it and and understand what's actually happening um but yeah I'm going to end there thank you for those who have watched and I will see you next time goodbye everyone
