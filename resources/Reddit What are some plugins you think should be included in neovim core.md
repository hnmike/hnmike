> - A plugin index. A plugin standard to separately publish a manifest entry, so there could be a downloadable index of all plugins that plugins managers could use (similar to how linux package managers work). It could make Neovim even lazier.

The advantage of making plugin features available in core (neo)vim is that you can use them when you're SSH-ing in a server, and the majority of plugins don't interact with your workflow when you don't use them (aside from maybe slowing down startup time, which is caused by them being plugins in the first place).

Would neovim be responsible for packaging the fuzzy finders? Would fzf become a dependentcy? Will fuzzy finders be statically linked? All of these options could double the size of the neovim installation just to include telescope. If you want OSes to include nvim as the default text editor, it can't be a 50mb binary or require dozens of arbitrary dependencies

Notably the inclusion of the Charles Campbell plugins; I mean no disrespect, but it feels quite arbitrary that his plugins were deemed worthy of inclusion compared to some of the more popular plugins (e.g. Tim Pope's). So why not add these more popular plugins in a transparent way that don't affect non-users?

Obviously neovim is pretty extensible and just because of that it's going to inevitably have a pretty high skill curve, and I'd never want to compromise on the extensibility of the application to cater towards ease of use, but goddamn is this piece of software daunting to get into.
