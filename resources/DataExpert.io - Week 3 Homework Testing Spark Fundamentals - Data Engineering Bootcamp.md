> for for for for hey \[Music\] everyone sorry I've been like not as active over the past week with it getting closer to Christmas I'm just finding that I have a lot less time because I've got like other stuff to do that I need to do on the night such as rapping and sorting out things for the family so yeah I just not had as much time over the last few days but but I'm still committed I'm still you know ready to finish this course it's just taking a little bit longer I'm I'm definitely going to get it done by January just over the next over Christmas I'm just going to not be as active just because it's Christmas and I want to spend time with my family but uh yeah so welcome back everyone and today we're going to be doing the homework testing I have I haven't done a lot of this yet I've only done I've only written like I've only written one test so far but I'm really really cocky when it comes to testing so I'm I'm I'm confident that I'm going to be fine um so today we're going to be writing tests so the homework is to compare two queries from week one to two from pest cure to sparkus cure so I'm just going to do week two queries just it doesn't how it said select two queries I'm going to select we two queries where is my where I put my queries actually they have disappeared there okay so these are my week two queries and I'm going to probably pick the converting to De list one here so create a device activity list for users device accumulated and I'm also going to select uh let's do yeah let's do that one and let's do the convert the data list in let's do those two I think that's a good a good a good shout so oh let me just link this chat to people on LinkedIn as well because I imagine there'll be a few people on LinkedIn that want link random question for people do you see the visit my website link on YouTube on on LinkedIn like because that goes to YouTube so I'm just curious if people actually see that because I often get questions from people saying that they can't they they cool so what we're going to do is the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go into our testing and well we're going go into our jobs and we're going to create a new job and I've already created the name for it but it's basically called daily device activity date list and then I am which isn't the name of the the this so I'm actually going to change this the name of this to be that what we can do is we can copy like this job here which does does does another SQL query but we we just need to change it to match our query go here and then we can call this that and then we can all this that and then we can do and then we can do I'm as well and so what I'm going to do is the first thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this select statement uh just the with today bit so this is our s SQL statement that we've got and the only thing that's different in this SQL versus versus uh py spark SQL is we need to change the way the AR the array is done so in in SQ in postgress SQL it's like this but actually what we need to do is like AR like that so there's the in two places that we actually need to change that and then we also just need to change the name of this as well which is going to be \[Music\] our to users devic accumulated so we've got our user devices accumulated here we also have two other um two other tables in here that we care about which is events and devices so we also need to create a rep a temporary view for that as well so we've got our um these in so we also need to change this data frame to be so we can have um events DF uh devices yeah and use your cumulative yeah so these are our these are our um dat data frames that we're using and then we can also just change so so now it all matches um and then we also need to pass in out other event so we've got our initial our initial users devices cumulated here and this is the conversion to pisar and so now we need to write our tests for this uh so so again similarly to what I just did there I can just copy um one of the other test and rewrite it so that it is in the format that I want so instead of importing from here I can import my my um Python and then as well as that what I'm do is I'm going to create a a like a tuple for my events my users and my events my devices and my users cumulative devices hi danan hi Denita was how do I pronounce your name Dan is that right is a check it's so cool how there's so many people from all different parts of the world so if we go here we can just do we can do events equals name Tuple and then we've got user ID event time and device ID so what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to put this here so we can see the exact columns that we need to get so yeah we've got user ID we've got uh event time and we got device ID as well as that we can have we can remove this as well we don't need this devices which which we need on that device ID so we need device ID and we need browser type as well as that uh we need our users cumulative table and so this um users devices accumulated I don't know why these are all should these be uppercase it feels wrong to have them uppercase but whatever hi Israel Peters that's nice nice to see and thanks for dropping by to say hello I appreciate that and so in our in our users device cumulated accumulated I can't say that word bloody we want to have the user ID device ID browser type dat and device activity J list which is that perfect and so once we've done that what we can do is we can then start creating our data so what I'm going to do is I'm going to write down the test that I want to create so I want to create a test for when when I haven't got any from the previous day test when no previous user data death I want to do a test when we've got multiple of the same row CU we are we want to test that it it gets rid of duplicates I'm just going to put these in like this for now just so that it doesn't go in eror I want to do a test on uh when I have data from the previous day and the current day yeah test when no new data that's a good test actually test when new data yep that's a good for specific user user device browser and then we want to do a test when new data or specific user and then we want to \[Music\] do y that's good that's the exact same thing we don't need that makes no sense so we want to do a test when what else you want to do a test I think there are main tests I think there are main tests so there's the the four tests from that that I think I want to or five tests that I think I want to test for so I always think it's really good to kind of highlight the the test that you want to do at the top just just so that you have a have a clear idea what it is that you want to want to do and then um and then it makes it a lot easier to then to then think about what your tests are going to write how you're going to write your tests so so that's like that did it um so the F the first one and I think this is going to be the easiest one is testing when there's no previous shoes you accumulated there so all we're doing is we're just going to test that our current data is is is going to be inputed into the user users cumulated table and that's all we care about so I'm just going to copy some of this here because I don't really want to rewrite it don't care about this this so I'm going to do uh event data equals uh so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to change this date here to be the first of January just so that it we can let's let's do that to be the second of January and let's do this to be the first just so that we can start from the month and then this can be o1 can be o1 and this can be o1 and then um let's do device data we're saying device one two three have that um oh we also want to test we also want to add another test um there test when user has multiple devices that that that it that that we get all of those users and then we do it we can do a test when user has multiple devices uh has multiple browsers device that's a good one um yeah we don't need to worry about that so those are the tests that I'm thinking of doing if any of them if you think any of them are redundant let me know but I think users device is accumulated so because I want this to be empty I so I'm not actually going to do that there what I'm going to do is I'm going to create the data frame but I'm just going to specify the columns because when you have a data frame empty like and you haven't specified The Columns then then it's it's not going to know what columns you're actually going to you want so basically that's what we're going to do um so vent data yeah so you can specify basically um yeah like that I'm pretty sure well I put the columns in directly but I'm pretty sure you can do that and then we're just going to pass that through to our actual DF so let's do do and then we just want to validate that the out expected values is equal to the actual values that that that get created so let's have a look here so if we have a look here we are saying that we want user one user two and user three and user one has device one user two has device to use a through device fre and we have browser type Chrome Firefox Safari we have this day and then we have this day here so that feels like it's right um yeah let's let's see what it gives us for that oh wait actually I know I need there's something I need to do here I need to convert this to a date time recognize this p is so useful Isel Peter says he's from the UK by the way oh that's cool me too honestly Co palette is so good for um for testing it's so it's so good so I've built everything in the uh virtual environment where is it here and if it R successfully you'll get a a DOT it's failed but I'm pretty sure I know why it's failed okay that's fine um so I'm just going to have to specify the schema in here that so user ID device ID browser type date device activity date list then I'm just going to make sure that yeah everything's going in there correctly for has anyone else done this homework by the way how have they found it okay so in here it wants to to do an order by then we probably want to do it by a b time yeah that's another difference from from postgress SQL to to PR spark SQL the thing that I always find really interesting about these is that they're so similar like there slight differences in it makes it really hard sometimes to to um to get it right okay so we're making good progress here um do I need to do this as date that oh no no no I don't need to do that that um that's already recognized as a date this needs to be a date here do you know what I can do I'm just going to do say equals there and then we can just use that maybe I should change it to a different name to be fair so once we've got one done it's going to be a lot easier to do the rest because once you've got like the columns figured out then you can do a lot you can you can figure it out a lot easier I don't want to be time I want to be date that's interesting so I'm just going to go back I found it interesting okay was something there what is it okay that's fine Cent date which equals time there go that should be right is ier okay so we're getting we've gotten further than we did before the actual isn't creating data frame for some reason why is it Notting a data frame let me just check all right I know what it is so in in here we're do the current date is 002 not 001 so I'm just going to replace this with 002 just so that we can verify because yeah it would just select nothing basically because the date is wrong winning winning winning happy the test pass happy days so now the rest should be relatively easy to do for for this is what when you really start like appreciating how how great co-pilot is because it's just so quick at doing once you've got one figured out it's so quick at doing the rest of it Al so by the way I don't know if anyone's seen this but like you can now get Co pilot for free so if anyone's interested you should totally do that yes so the T one we just testing that these duplicate RS only end up being one R then we can do so what we're going to do now is we're going to going to do the flip side so we're going to test the when this and this is no look this has already got uses in that it doesn't override them oh wait we can still put the data in but we can just not set it to the current date cuz you'll kind of still want to test that the data that was there is still valid I'm I going to BL that CU I want to make sure that it it still works and then what I'll do is I'll just put one user in here and same with devices so what I'll do what I can do um is let's rename this do that like that yeah it's honestly amazing I think the TR the challenges really is um is just that you have to get it to this point once you've got it to this point it's really really good it's just getting it to this point that can sometimes be tricky so what we're saying here is we just want to validate that all the previous data has been carried over even though we've done this selected State table why have you doing that all should probably put that up there as well arrange I'm I'm I'm wondering whether or not I need to comment this as well because the llm a lot of the time wants you to comment things even though I think comments are just annoying and just take up I just think they add add boil way too much boiler plate I'm sorry I know um I'm kind of going all over the place at the moment I'm just restructuring the the um test so it's a bit better ordered because I thought it was a bit all over the place before e for I'm hoping by just ordering it like this it's a bit more readable as well that you can kind of see what what we're doing here okay so what is mying my partner's making a white racket honestly like it's really funny like because I I use this so much now like no they should be the previous data it should be the previous data oh no this should be the previous data he's making AET this should be the current date I'm pretty sure yeah so we're basically saying that for the current day we just in the device activity date list we only have the previous date and actually we only care about like T oh it's the bloody washing machine that's what's going on really loud yeah that should work cool oo all tests pass so now we've got three Test passing and let's add a new test one thing that's really good as well is if you're specific enough with the title of what it is you want to test it writes a lot for you so good so we're basically saying when we've got new data for one person we want to verify that the expected data has added the current date for that person oh God honestly I love I know I keep saying it it feels like this is an ad for C palette it's really not um I suppose I work for the company who like her palette so it is kind of um self-promotion but yeah so that was for yesterday's look at today's is taking the user that we've updated here and he's adding that to the DAT awesome that should also work the only thing I don't like about this is how long the test take to takes way too long don't like it so what I want to test here is I want to test so this is slightly wrong I do want to test but for new data for specific user device browser and no previous data but I also want to test that there were other users in there as well so what I want to do in here is I want to add a couple of users that aren't in in the the event data just to test that they still sure in the latest but they shouldn't have the current date they should have the previous date so we need to have the previous date in here as well and then we need to update this here to the previous date and then in here in our date list array these two will have the previous date still because they haven't got any there isn't any data Associated them in here and then in here we're just testing that when one user has multiple devices that it adds each of those days I suppose actually that's no this is right we want this to be and what I like to do actually is I like to try and when I do my tests localize it to the one thing that I'm testing just so that it it's definitely testing that thing rather than been affected by other things I think people have different opinions on this as well like a lot of people try and add too many abstractions in testing and I actually think making it readable is more important when device across that needs to be that okay so let's just check the data is right here so the same device across multiple users and \[Music\] then I'm going to do same device multiple same browser I'm ignoring that comment for all right so we're basically just testing that it populates the right data and then the last test I want to do is I want to do test when multiple dates in \[Music\] events only good day okay so let's just check what Co palette is giving us here I'm just going to say and then that way one two three and so we should only return and stay here that should be used two okay I could honestly keep going all the way um where is our oh I'm really glad that they're helping actually that's really that's really nice it's been one of the things like um been not quite nice actually about this is I've always been really like paranoid about people watching me like feeling like oh like you know what I'm not do good enough or or whatever but um but there's been a lot of people saying that it's been helping so I'm glad that like it's actually helping people okay so some of my tests that I've written are giv the right results let's have a look okay so test for news it has multiple browsers okay yeah that's fine so this needs to be one and one and this needs to be one and one cuz we're only testing the browsers we're not testing the device ID and then which one are you which which which spark are you referring to are you referring to the first one of this one here this need to be so I personally find this one quite easy um but but my I've done a lot of test testing in my career so and and I I have a very like test driven brain in the sense of I can visualize the various different scenarios in my head but I haven't done a lot of Pi back so I did find homework three quite difficult but but I do have um a I do have uh live streams for each of the homeworks that I've done so if you did want to have a look and see any of them they are there so that you can check them out hopefully they'll help if if if you are struggling at all I would say if I was going to give each each one a rating out of of 10 um I would give the first two the first one is seven the second one is six the third one an eight and this one a five um no this not this one's four this one this is one this one um but um but I did find the third one quite hard but I think I was over complicating it as well for a while and I made the mistake of writing Scala first as well instead of just python um because I thought we were meant to do Scala because of the lab but it was python that he wanted so so that that didn't help um I think once you understand what I definitely recommend like just trying to understand what the repartition the sort within partition and the bucket buy are doing separately because they're the three things that for me took a little bit of time to get my head around of why I was doing all three but once I understood that it became a lot easier right so one more test in here and then we're going to move on to the next the next one for no I w't B with that test I don't think I need to yeah I think I think the how how how good are you with SQL like have you are you familiar with it yeah yeah he's been fine with me showing the homework part think like I've asked him if he's cool with everything that I do um and he's been absolutely fine with everything that I've done I've not like I've always checked with him I doubt like so this is all his free content and I think for for him he can't really stop like it's not like this is propriety in terms of like it's it's behind a pair wall so he's he's always been pretty chill with me doing it um and I think it's probably good for him because because it's a way of helping people without like he can like Point people to like or have you watched what what this person's done or what that person's done hopefully that'll help I don't publish what I've written anywhere so if anyone does watch this they can't just they can't just like copy everything that I've done like like without like going through it themselves so so I'm waiting until the free boot camp ends before I publish my homework anywhere um so yeah he's been really cool about about me doing it to be fair um and yeah I always I always check but with the paid boot camp I don't think I'm going to be able to show any of that because that that'll be like that would be probably quite bad um so unfortunately I won't be able to do that but when I do the page boot camp I'm probably going to do more of my all stuff on my channel instead just because just because um I think that'll be good no it's not I paid for I paid for it um but it's it's a bit like Microsoft training is a bit weird so like you get access to AAL training but like you can't get your own like specific training so you don't have like a budget to to spend wherever you want but you get a lot of access to Lo of training material um so so I I can do for example any of the Microsoft certifications and I can get any of the aour certifications without paying for it but but like it's very difficult to get training outside of that if that makes sense okay so we tested our daily device activate date list so the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to rename that as well the next thing I'm going to test is I'm going to test um the what's it called what the homewor too I'm going to test my users device do list in this one here I should have just um I should have just picked uh this as a test knif well that would have been funny don't think I quite got away with that one for I'm just going to check is there any arrays in here that I need to change I don't think so yeah there is one one here let me just do a search as well yeah it's just that one there okay so so I'm just going to change the names of the data frames that are going to go in here user devices yeah I think that's the only thing that I need actually oh thank you that's really kind um I really appreciate that I think I think it depends on on um on how you it really depends on the individual I think so for me I I really see a benefit in testing like as you can see here like it's not taking me that long to once I've written the pipeline got it to work in the way that I want to write test for it to to validate that it does what I want but um but if you're someone who struggles with testing and it does take a while to get to that point then I can understand why it might be hard and like if your data is changing all the time like if you are getting new requests all the time to change your pipelines because it's not quite right then um I can see why that would be bothersome um but I personally quite like it I think for me it fits my way of my brain and the way that my brain works um and I like the fact that I can think okay if I put this data in then I should get this data out and write a test for it I think that's really really beneficial but um I definitely agree that a lot of the time it's just the fact that you've got bad data but but I think what you should be doing with testing is when you do have a scenario like that like where something an anomaly comes in and you fix it that's a perfect example of when to WR test for it to to prove that you fixed it a thank you chance nice good night have a good have a good night bye so we don't need events anymore that then we're just going to change this to be our date list in and then we're just going to change this to just be our users devices accumulated that we're passing in um we don't need that I don't know why we put that there CH series um I'm going to add my book bits in here but I don't think I don't think the lm's going to like it so I'll add it in but um so basically for those who didn't follow my previous one um this is date 31 minus 31 which is zero but um no no um so you've got two to the power of P2 which which will not fit into a bit 32 like in um thing so it actually needs to be 2 to the^ 31 to actually work so you need to put a minus one there as well but it doesn't but I'm just going to see if it works maybe we could just do you can do 31 let's just do 31 2^ 31 minus that let's try that sorry I'm just talking to myself like a insan person that's not that was Aus yeah okay so let's copy this change this to then we can have our users device accumulated we can have our user all these test we remove all but one nice to keep the form one but you don't need all of them because you just end up having Noise Okay so we can have un to list in and then let's just check on the values that we need in there so we've got user ID we've got device ID got browser type we've got device activity dat list and we've got date list in is that the right table that's not the right table let's look at the actual right table so we've got user ID device ID browser type device activity dat list and in cool so we have all of our things so I'm just going to do a test where the user is active every day and we should have like whole list of ones for for use the devices de uses I am not using a format but it's just because I haven't set it up and it's not set up water in the um in the project I should set one up early but I've just not been bothered to do it um okay so we're just creating our date \[Music\] here and then expected values is going to be we might have to convert that to a bit I'm not sure we do need to change this to be wa e e okay and then okay so we're just going to check that these are equal to each other um I'm not sure about the the one here we might need to convert this but see so I need to Google how um let me CH You2 actually to SQL a okay so apparently there is this here now we'll see if that's true yeah SP that oh crap I haven't saved it ESC for okay so it's running the value still what I might need to do is might need to delete the tests that I don't care about or comment them out cuz waiting for all these tests that come up to them okay so we also have an unsupported data type so bit 32 is unsupported um 32 do for come we'll just do that then um we'll do that so we'll just store this as a integer um rather than unfortunately it would have been nice to start as a to but if it isn't supported then it isn't supported and then we can just verify that it is um for I'm assuming that's to expected number let's do two I think it's going to be better um should okay let's try that does not okay um we need to also find out what the alternative is for um generate series as well for for okay that's fine I'll create a Temp View that makes sense 31 open for yeah seems similar to what we have before so let's try that then dat series dat series start from zero here let's install that then install e e okay we're getting Clos for this now it's fine just need to do a cast that's fine is actually going to work is it going to work for e e e e okay this needs to be as serious there this is a wholey boot C nice are you trying to switch to dat engineer from another world are you coming from Dev apps or software engineer background uh I am a software engineer but I also do a lot of devops in my role as well uh I am not looking to switch to being a data engineer but we wear a lot of hats in my department we have to do a lot of different things so data engineering is just another area that I want to get into just going to add this formatting cuz you're right I should add it you want I'm just going to do something here I'm just going to do back range and then I'm going to do spal this here I'm going to just take out now I'm going to see if if I can get into here um for for e to figure out how um see if I need to \[Music\] I okay split in hopefully this is the last change such an night when you have to convert things Co pilot so useful for stuff like that you know you need to like change the um sorry I say chap but is so useful stuff like that um you know you need to come back from like one language to another there a slight difference and like how do I do this and this new language okay this is good the FM are not equal I know why I know why they're not equal this needs to be go in here to the power 32 minus one not I'm pretty sure yeah just going to print this value here for e e okay yep no that's that's right so this needs to be minus two because if we just say we print this off let me just print this off so you can see the number um what did they say to do okay for functions in call and then we want the column list in this in bit Sim do that with the actual VF as well and be because it's a 32 bit number you're always going to have zero at the end of it because you've only got 31 days in a month maximum so because January's got 31 days and we're only calculating 31 days you is going to end up with zero at the end of the bit if we're starting from one on the top for e it's e e that's fine what we'll do is um the bit for we do the same thing for this as well just just to show you that we're not just um talking rubbish and then I'll probably move it back for okay so what I probably think I should do is rather than doing this I should have this as a bind binary number and then do the conversion in here so that we can say this is definitely the number we want um yeah okay that's fine for Okay so do this and just count one two three put zero there uh then this and then we can just say we just want to basically verify that that's the same as what we want it to be which I know is a bit awkward it's not a nice way of doing it but it's the only way we've got I'm just that works but as you can see because we've only got 31 days in the month you don't you never you're never going to bu this so if someone was active for the full month this is always going to be zero cool perfect then we can do death test a there why not never for I think that the main test that I want to do for for all right okay e for I think it's because this is empty and we need to specify what the type is when it's empty uh so I don't know what the best way to do that is um for e okay so I think I need to use a DAT glass instead of a two for e otherwise I'll specify in here again that's fine I'm just going to do it the way that I've did it previously okay for is anyone doing anything nice these holidays I'm going to a spa okay for do don't I just want it to be empty for I'm just gonna verify that it's you know what what I'm going to do is I'm going to put this to 2022 because we're only getting the last 30 days we the data so this should return zero just the only reason I'm doing that is because I just want to verify that okay yeah that's fine we just need to convert the dirt e e no I think it will get there's nothing in here that doesn't get anything yeah yeah it's fine I don't think that'll work actually e okay this is good I'm just deleting these cuz I can't be ask wait for for I think I'm done pretty much so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy these so I can export them easily from from WSL so I'm just copying this to my local machine I'm going toate Z for e e e do is I'm going to go to data expert now and I'm going to submit that and I'm probably going to fail because I always SP the first time because the bloody a AI just decides that I haven't added enough comments or whatever um but we will see what it says this time choose file so just submitted that now okay it's not a significant deviation that is not a right let let me just go into here convert two queries it just say to get two queries it doesn't say which queries just two whatever right let's get on with it that's that for open docker Sor that's annoyed me that like I would if you want specific like for me if you want specific things testing you specify that you want specific things testing before you do the homework to what I M FES need to stop open for for what I find really interesting is where does it get my image from e okay so we need to get actors de we need to get active films to yeah f for yeah e what should the hell for e all this just history that and then do that and then in here let's pass through we need film oop e for e get rid of all these uh hi I have no idea I think I've had a couple of mentees doing courses like that and he's learning a lot from it so so my co M was doing been learning a lot from it so I think it's good you just I think you need to have that self disip able complete it e e we're testing when there's only new actess in e e e e e e e I and F the types far comment these out cuz they're just taking too long e yeah this is new but just two eyes and all see my good old friend can sort this out for me all right okay change this then join this night not been saved properly something I don't think that was say proper for e no it's not on GitHub at the moment um probably won't put it on even coot thinks it should have an UND score where is this act as that's just replaceing it now e for e e ch e e for it's just confusing just have it as with an underscore you know should be legal to have it without an underscore yes thank God for that all right let's do our next test death best for e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e feel thank e e e for for e for e for e e e for e e done e e e e e e e e e than e e e time okay this for it's just this Bu The Ordering can't believe that that was painful for e for awesome so we've got that added now move that um is there any other test that I want to do let just check e thing I'm testing is whether or not the actor has different ratings I really need to add some more to this actually cuz we're not actually we don't have that is active on here for e for e e e e e e e probably it's not going to work first time because I've done her pal done most of that buted for e e e e great e e e you're I'm just going to leave at that I think and see if I for I feel like I've proved that I can I can WR tests and I'm done for the night I'm just going to tr for just hopefully this is enough we'll see if it's not then I'll I'll do the rest tomorrow because I'm tired and I want to go to bed and I'm really annoyed that like I had it wasn't specified that this it would been one of the things to do earlier for e that's cool we've got an air that's fabulous um okay so let's have a look first I almost commend you for the comprehensive set ofile but tested the job supports cumulative data transformation is in Sp the use of cosmics the query logic straight forward to follow encapsulation of logic to with practice right we got there we got that in the end so the only reason I got see the first time was because apparently I was meant to do another table that I wasn't told about and I've done it and as you can see we've done it we've done it guys thank you for watching I'm going to end there because it is time for them to go to bed thank you goodbye see you I'll see you next time and thanks for anyone who's like watched all the way through I mean this has been a ridiculously long stream for
