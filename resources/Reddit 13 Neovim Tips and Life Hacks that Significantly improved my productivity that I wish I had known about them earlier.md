The numbers don’t even need to be the only contents of their respective lines. They also don’t even need to be the only numbers on the lines nor aligned to the same column number.

> You can use + to go down to a non empty character and - to go up to a non empty character. So when you see some code indented inside a block you can just do something like 2- or 2+ to just jump to the first character instead of going 2k and 2j which will put you at the start of a line which could be a whitespace then you would have to do w to go to the next word. Neat little trick i just learned.

> For number 2, the same goes for c and d. You can do `cib` `dib`, aswell as `cab` and `dab`. Also works for quotes, you can do `ci"` or `di"` aswell as the a versions. If you didn't now you can actually run these keycombos from anywhere in the line as long as you are in front of the quotes or brackets.
> 
> For number 8, a macro can have any letter as its 'name' so i mean qq is probably the fastest but you can have many different macros stored but doing qa for example to store a macro in a, then @a to execute the macro.
