> hello everybody welcome you all to my new video actually my today's videos title is initial complexities when you are very new relatively new in Kafka and want to implement CDC okay so you will find a lot of examples videos in the YouTube but point you try to follow this tutorials and compost files and Kafka settings you might not be able to complete CDC okay there is a lot of reasons behind it I will try to figure out some of those uh ways I faced when I tried to implement this um I will show you how I overcome these problems okay so what happened I followed a lot of tutorials on the internet they showed very easily but they are very expert and that's why they organize them who maintains halfway the environment was managed in such a way they didn't face these issues okay but when you will try to if you do not follow this procedure from the very beginning and just kicking start with this compost yml you may fail into some problems okay no problems actually a slightly different configuration will take your whole day or several days okay so first of all I use Harvest you just explore things don't take tensions or don't hurry don't be hurry because it is not very simple you must have to have some ideas on broker on kasakani it is a huge thing and registry schema registry and caves kill DB okay and you will get these things by experiencing okay not just reading block or just uh following others okay you have to experience this so let me jump into my configuration first and what problem I faced I will tell you step by step okay so here is my whole structure that has four uh data and my configuration structure as you can see I have my MySQL sync and MySQL source initially I was trying with mySQL 7 MySQL 5 okay so it brings me few problem that this table does not belong to information the schema these this so I Googled it and I found that if I use my skill 8 it results some issues okay so I used my custom MySQL configuration because you have to enable your B log and you have to allow your MySQL to connect from other device that's why you have to bind ip00 High testing your okay MySQL configuration MySQL service so that's why I built my own MySQL on configuration I will provide the whole thing and if you just within a few click you will got the serious character okay I promise I will provide all the configuration in the description of my video okay another thing I would like to point out here you can use root password simply you can use root password nothing else and I missed out this photo increment true and use SSL false okay if you not use use SSL files in mysql5 then it create some issues I don't know in my escalator toolkit or not but in my skill 5-bit create issues and it actually support me law a lot okay so I make this series SSL false okay and another important things a lot of things looking uh is is very important for me but it will not for all because they are very expert in configuration and they are well known of these things but it's very important for me what should I use this topic when thinking okay so there is a creation correlation with same configuration and Source configuration okay like look at the top you will got this so first of all you have to know that what will you work and what to do not if you use above converter you have to use a broken button you think okay so there is some dependency version dependency you started work working with CDC uh or lack of knowledge you can't be successed with the single wrong setting okay wrong configuration so you must have to go multiple blocks and in the right way okay initially or um actually I first of all I want to get some success and then I want to explore more but if you get failed in the very beginning that we got hopeless that it is very hard okay so I would like to give you a good start so I will share I will share this link also in the in my video description if you use apple converter and in your sync you if you use Json company will not work so you can follow this I followed this I used every Commodore both of both of my source onboard configuration and ever configuration okay this is and okay my bad m another thing is uh okay this this record value record value PK field and PK mode what is PK mode primary key mode okay and PK Fields movie ID you must have to this uh have in this movie ID in your uh Source schema or data then you will it will it will generate issues so another important thing is how do you get to know about these issues always you have to go to your uh and loss it will tell you everything okay what you need to know about what you have you will find these things from your connect loss or into MySQL box okay just don't be hopeless follow the logs and try to solve this step by step okay so this log will explain all what you need actually I am very weak in English I beg your pardon bear with me you will you probably will be helped okay by me so that's it I I uh initially uh found find very confusing that what should I do what is the problem should I use my skill 7 or is this right this converter blah blah blah blah okay so this thing worked for me and or I will provide this MySQL sync source and all these things just you have to click and wait okay nothing so you will got these things what is happening here so let me go to the MySQL configuration suppose here is my Docker file here I am taking this lattice and my own configuration and my user SQL here is my user SQL this is the risk I am copying to the docker entry point dash n8db dot d here if you put another SQL it will executed it will be executed when this MySQL uh container is starting okay and if you look at my configuration you will see my bean log service configuration here I I put manually from the internet here also my custom configuration I put it here and here is my binder at this zero zero zero okay so this is my configuration for sync but for my source I have another SQL movies SQL it will okay create this database and insert this data database demo and use demo and insert them okay and create this table lamp Okay this fields and here is the movie ID it will put this datas in my movie table okay so that's it and if I show you my compose IML you will see here is my connect and here is my control center here is my sync database configuration okay I am I am building this sync database database here with the compost file you can create this MySQL compost with this MySQL instance um detestly okay down here is my source MySQL configuration and here is case skill review okay that's it so that's it my compost driver and what is this configuration if I um show you my source configuration here you can put your Docker internal IP address okay and I am using my user and password I put where my uh look when I compost my MySQL instance here my root password okay so that's why I am using my root my database password is password and look here is my MySQL server server name and you must have to whitelist your data table and broker and this movie's topic you can't use this movie's topic actually when you are creating this Source it will create two more Network here this little bit confusing than others movie server movie Services \[Music\] um let me let me show you if you show topic here you will see three topics and if you pin this topic movies it will print actual data but other topics just okay so don't confuse don't be confused and might be some other tutorial they have only one topic okay so don't be confused just try and you will get success and it is beautiful after walking or with CDC and for the beginner I actually I'm getting this change that a cats are walking is is fantastic experience for me actually okay so this is my source connection configuration and if I show you my this is this was my source configuration okay and this is my SIM card version right now so I showed you earlier so so that's it no it is just initial I can now play with this so I can now play with this configuration but if it's not working the first time how come on I go further stiff okay so that's it so for you guys I'd like to show you another thing this data folder here you can see my elastics has connect gdbc and davidm connector and this this this connector or initially installed and store this here that's why my Docker compose yml in my connect I hide these things okay where I hide these things ah it will not install in the next step but in the first time if you can this will install your division connector Kafka connector and this this then after then if after installing you can apply this configuration okay initially I thought I need not to install anything then I can only apply this configuration no brother you have to install this plugin first and then you have option for configuration okay so another thing after starting all things you can not find any connector here initially but you have to wait two or three minutes or restart your connector got it you have to put questions it's a experiencing thing you can't find it in others videos or blog okay you have to wait you have to keep patience and you have to go through you have to go all in okay um that's it so let me show you how it's working look after running all these configuration I have my source source database and my sync database in my source database if I sense here finally okay you may see my okay you see my thing that I was okay and I'm still here but if I refresh this should show me finally okay that's how mine says data capacity so if it is benefited for you please do subscribe my channel and if if you have further questions please do ask me and I will provide this all these things actually I I need these things what I need I do not need this query actually so I delete this folder okay and here is my elastic configuration you can run this okay you can put your own elastic Source URL so it will work it will it will transfer your data in the elastic search okay it's it I didn't didn't use this okay um I I it is made off actually okay and this is my note okay it is just not so I think you will not need this okay so that's it so now what will I do I can push it in the GitHub I will push it in the GitHub and provide all these things and all you need to do just run here Docker compost up and run this Source configuration from here if you don't know go to here click on connect and upload configuration and next source and sync okay and after after that it will start working but before that in your sink database as you can see that I have here movies SQL but here I don't have any movies SQL okay so I can also you have to create manually this uh demo database only in the in your sync database because you have to just create the database not the table it will your CDC actually your connector will automatically create the tables not the database so first of all in your sync you can you have to create the database okay also then after you can apply this configuration from here and it will start working as expected Okay so thank you and ask me any question if you have

> - **Use MySQL 8+ for CDC:** Older versions may cause issues with schema information (0:30).
> - **Enable Binary Logging (BLog):** Configure your MySQL instance to allow connections from other devices by binding to IP 0.0.0.0 (3:39).
> - **Set `auto_increment` and `useSSL`:** Ensure `auto_increment` is set to `true` and `useSSL` to `false` in MySQL configuration (4:25).
> - **Understand topic naming:** Be aware that Debezium may create multiple topics (e.g., `movies`, `movies.server`, etc.) (11:34).
> - **Install connectors before configuring:** Ensure Debezium and JDBC connectors are installed before applying configurations (14:00).
> - **Wait or restart:** After starting, connectors might not appear immediately; wait a few minutes or restart the connector (14:32).
> - **Check logs for errors:** Use logs to troubleshoot issues and understand required configurations (7:32).
