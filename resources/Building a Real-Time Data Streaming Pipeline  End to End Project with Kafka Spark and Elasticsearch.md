> [!summary]- Description
> \#\#\# Technologies Featured:
> 
> *\#ConfluentKafka \#Elasticsearch \#MongoDB \#ApacheSpark \#HuggingFace \#DataFlow*
> 
> \#\#\# Overview:
> 
> In this video, you’ll learn how to construct a *real-time data streaming pipeline* using a dataset of *7 million records* . We’ll harness a robust stack of tools and technologies, including *Apache Spark, MongoDB Atlas, HuggingFace's DistilBERT Text-Classification Model, Confluent Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.*
> 
> \#\#\# What You'll Learn:
> 
> - How to set up and configure a Kafka topic for seamless data transmission in Kaggle Notebooks.
> - Streaming data from Kafka topics using Apache Spark.
> - Performing real-time sentiment analysis with HuggingFace models.
> - Establishing Kafka for efficient real-time data ingestion and distribution.
> - Utilizing Elasticsearch for enhanced data indexing and search capabilities.
