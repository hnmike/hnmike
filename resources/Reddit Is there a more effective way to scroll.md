> I use folds so I don't actually scroll that much. There are half and whole page scrolling if you want, you might want to remap them so that you cursor be at the middle of the screen after scrolling. Still, I would suggest you give folds(automatically with treesitter or lsp) a try, whenever I wanna find something by scrolling, I would close all the fold, find where the fold that might contain the thing I look for is and open it. Save lots of key press when your file contains 1000s of lines.

> Unpopular opinion: using the mouse is totally fine. Pick the right tool for the job, not only your hammer. For many tasks, keyboard commands and shortcuts are great and a lot quicker; but for other tasks using a pointer device is just more intuitive and quicker.  
> Code is read a lot more often than written, so "editing speed" in reality doesn't matter that much, and when you're just reading code using the mouse to scroll is totally fine.
> 
> Another example is resizing and moving your splits around: sure I can use half a dozen `C-w` shortcuts, OR I could just grab the window borders with my mouse real quick. Especially if there's 3 splits.

> I have the same issue. There is no way keyboard is more effective than an unlocked mouse wheel on Logitech mouse. Yes, there is the issue that you have to lift your hand from the keyboard and you have to give up on it. But this doesn't mean keyboard jumps are better.

> Scrolling isn't needed.

> For close navigation, you have Ctrl-d, ctrl-u, ctrl-d, ctrl-b.

> Typically you'd scroll for one of these reasons:

> 1. Find something specific but not sure where it is: use symbols or fuzzy search for this.
> 2. Navigate through an unknown file slowly to explore: ctrl-d, ctrl-u and hjkl are great for this. Even zz, zt, zm
> 3. Navigate back to something after referencing something else: ctrl-o, ctrl-i, ctrl-t OR marks OR harpoon / grapple.

> You'll never get VIM if you use the mouse with it. The mouse is anti-vim. Go by full pages with control-f and control-b. This is more effective than mouse scrolling because there's less motion. It also keeps your hands on the keyboard.
> 
> If "need" to keep your eyes in the same spot and have text flow past, you can do that too: control-y and control-e move the text within the view port; exactly like mouse scrolling; just without the mouse. I think this is extremely inefficient, but you do you on that. Just please, please, please stop using the mouse with vim.

There are many shared concepts between the 3. But anyone trying to do motorcycle centric moves in a plane would instantly be told they were wrong. Because they are.

I was going to talk about why I think this is a disadvantage overall, but I don't think I'm going to convince you. You and others here seem angry that anyone would question the way they use VIM. That's fine. Carry on. I don't think I have anything more to say here.
