code quality in react
- While React and JavaScript in general are great on their own, both can become significantly more pleasant to work with if you introduce some developer tooling to assist with managing complexity.
- Linting is great for enforcing style guides and reduces errors and ESLint is among the most popular linters available.
- formatter reduce a lot of discussion and time spent on stylistic debates and fully automates the entire process of formatting the code as agreed upon. Prettier is the most used tool for formatting.
- React has a built-in system for validating property types passed to all the components in the codebase, but it is an older system with significant drawbacks compared to TypeScript.
- The React Developer Tools plugin includes a powerful Components Inspector tool that allows users to inspect and manipulate component props, memoized nodes, and stateful hooks.
- The Components Inspector provides features such as searching and filtering components, toggling modes and options, and highlighting memoized components.
- The Profiler tool, although more complex, helps in understanding application performance by recording and analyzing function invocations, component re-renders, effects, events, and more. It requires experience to fully utilize and understand its capabilities.
- These four utilities have overlapping responsibilities, but you might still see several or even all of them applied to projects in the wild. You will even see me using quite a few of them in future examples and projects in this book
