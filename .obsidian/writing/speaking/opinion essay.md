While the benefits of becoming food independent are clear, I would argue it is not a practical goal for many nations

Pros of becoming food independent:
- locally produced foods tend to be more affordable -> more economical options for resident
- reduced food miles -> a reduction in carbon footprint (air pollution & global warming)
- facilitate the growth of the agricultural field -> an increase in agriculture-related job opportunities -> reduce unemployment
Not all countries can produce enough food to feed their populations
	Japan: hostile climate and infertile land
	Singapore: limited agricultural land
	African countries: prolonged droughts

Sample:
One school of though holds their countries should try to become food self-reliant/self-sufficient .While acknowledge the reasons for this proponent , I would argue that it is not practical in many parts of the world

On the other hand, there are good reasons for advocating the policy of food independence. First, increasing domestic food production can lead to more employment opportunities in the field of agriculture, thereby reducing the unemployment rate. This can be seen in rural region in Vietnam, where an emphasis on agricultural development  has helped ensure year-round production, creating thousands of jobs for the locals and preventing seasonal unemployment. In addition to this , depending on foreign food supplies can be risky, especially during global crisis
On the other hand, there are good reasons for advocating the policy of food independence. First, increasing the food production can facilitate the growth of the agricultural field, thereby increasing the job opportunities for people and reducing a rate of unemployment. In addition to this, the dependence on food supplies can reduce the food miles, this can be seen in a less carbon footprint in the air pollution and global warming.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned arguments, I am convinced that solely depending on domestic food production  is far from a realistic goal for many nations. To specify, geographic and climatic conditions in many regions are simply not suitable for agricultural practices. Japan is a case  in point. Its infertile soild, coupled with hostile climate, severely limits its agricultural capacity, making self-sufficiency in food production a hardly attainable goal. By the same token, in the  light of prolonged droughts, it  would be virtually impossible for South Sudan to produce enough food to feed its population. For these countries, avoiding food imports could actually be tantamount to causing national food shortages.
in conclusion, while there are justifications for supporting the proposal of food self-reliance, I am of the opinion that it is not feasible option for all countries particularly in regions where natural conditions are unfavorable for agriculture, food imports remain an indispensable means to ensure national food security.
