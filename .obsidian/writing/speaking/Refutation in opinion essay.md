Benefits of using refutations:
	refutation in paragraph show opposite side of viewpoints or counter-arguments -> develop your critical thinking and linear thoughts. 

Example of refutation
physical books and ebook
arguments -> pinpoint the flaws/problems of points
many argue that e books are superior to physical books because they save space and are more environmentally friendly. However, this argument overlooks the tangible experience of reading a physical books. Physical books provide sensory experience, for examples, the smell of the pages, the heft of the book in other's hands, and the visual satisfaction of the book mark. Furthermore, the environmental impact of e-books is not negligible. The production of electronic devices, their batteries, and the energy consumed when using and charging them can have substantial environmental costs.

remote work vs office work
some business leaders assert that the office work is superior to remote work because it fosters team collaboration and ensure the employee productivity. Nevertheless, this argument overlook the potential benefits of remote work. Modern technology offers a myriad of tools that facilitate online collaboration just effectively as in-person meetings. Additionally, many studies have shown that workers often report higher levels of productivity and job satisfaction. This is because they can craft their optimal work environment and often face fewer distractions. In light of this, it is clear that the traditional office setup is not necessarily the gold standard for productivity and collaboration


How to refute arguments in writing 
Step1: Propose an argument(explain why people think that )
Step 2: Counter-argue by pointing out flaws or problems in this thinking


More examples
The best way to solve the world environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels.
Key takeaways: 
Overgeneralization >< Oversimplification 
Better ways -> compare
fossil fuel:coal , natural gas , oil, gasoline
transportation + production
Outline
position: there are better ways to tackle this environmental problems
body 1: 
basic economic principle of supply and demand
theoretically, a reduction in demand for fuels, reduce the emission of C02, one of the chief process for air pollution and climate change
"However" 
- This can lead to inflation(economic repercussions)
- Heavily reliant on fossil fuels -> an increase in the prices would not really bring down the demand for them
- many environmental degradation are largely unrelated to fuel consumption -> increasing their prices could hardly improve the situation.
Body 2: Justify the " better way "
- promoter alternative energy -> reduce on reliance on fossil fuel -> reduce the volume of CO2 emitted
- raise public awareness -> cultivate a more environmentally conscious society 
- tighten the policy or environmental regulations

Sample 
One school of though holds that rising the fuel prices is the foremost method of solving the environmental problems. While acknowledging the reasons for this, I would argue that there are other superior methods.

Granted, proponents of increasing fuel costs might argue based on the principle of supply and demand. Higher fuel prices, they say, would lead to reduction in demand for fossil fuels, which would be synonymous with lower C02 emission-one of the chief contributors to global warming and air pollution. However,this perspective overlooks our current heavy reliance on fossil fuels, as evidenced by almost all vehicles use gasoline. This means modifying their prices would have negligible bearing on demand for them.It is also noteworthy that many environmental problems like deforestation are largely unrelated to fuel consumption. and an increase in fuel price could hardly improve the situation 
given the aforementioned limitations, I am convincing that the following measures would be more effective in tacking the environmental challenges. First, it is imperative that the greener alternatives to fossil fuels be developed and made more commonplace.This could be key to reducing our reliance on the latter as a source of energy, leading to reduced volumes of carbon dioxide emitted. Such measures should be executed in tandem with imposing more stringent regulations on environmental protection. For example, illegal loggers should receive life sentences rather than a fine or a few month in prison. Such drastic actions could go a long way towards deterring other people from causing damage to the surrondings, thereby protecting the environment without having interfere with the energy market.
