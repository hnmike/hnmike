 When employees are given a long holiday, they would become more empowered to work 
 being given a long holiday could empower employees, leading to a better performance.
 some people think that giving holidays at least one month to employees could positively increse their performance at their workplace.this essay will examine the reasons 
 On the other hand, there are some reasons that explain why giving employees an extensive 
  vacation around one month could be highly beneficial for their performance. 
  Although a balance between professional and personal obligations has been proven to determine the productivity level of workers, achieving it has been elusive due to the heavy workload that is ubiquituos in all modern offices.If a prolonged vacation is given, many individuals could finally spend quality time back the quality time with their family and loved ones, recharging energy and giving them back the ability to work productively.
  Nowadays,achieving a balance between professional and personal lives has become exceedingly hard given the hectic schedule of modern workplace. Thus, many workers are gradually burnt out both mentally and physically, limiting ability to contribute optimally to their lives. If employers give their workers a prolonged vacation, they could spend time with their loved ones, giving them a chance to re-energize to come back to work with a higher level of productivity.
on the other hand, an extensively prolonged holiday of around one month may disrupt the workflow while causing the damage to the operation of a business.The ability to function optimally of any firm depends on the connection between employees, which is built through regular exchange of information that covers novel ideas and solutions. When workers are allowed to take vacations in a longer period of time, these network of communication is broken down, causing issues for the firm to operate at best. Also, such a long period of break could make it impossible for workers to remember many professional training and procedures, causing waste as their companies must restart for them from the beginning.
In conclusion, though there are debates about the visibility of giving employees a prolonged holiday to encourage a better performance, I believe that this should be applied only to a selective number of excellent individuals. While the conception of a long vacation is appealing, it may lead to some unwanted disruptions that damage the profitability of a business.
