			"text":"data tools \n\nNote: Certain startups may fall into multiple categories and sub-categories; for the sake of simplicity we have assigned each company a single sub-category, unless their offerings were wide enough to be categorised as Data Platform. US Companies started in Europe are also included in the map.\n\nAn exercise in data analytics and visualisation\nBased on the c.250 companies based out of Europe and Israel featured in our market map, we dig deeper into market trends, everything from data ecosystem areas attracting the most founders and investments, to how these startups are leveraging AI in data infrastructure tooling.\n\nWhich areas of the data ecosystem are seeing most startups being founded?\nNumber of data startups by year of founding and category\n\n\nSource: MMC\n\nData startups by year of founding, category as % of total\n\n\nSource: MMC\n\nData Serving (chiefly data analytics and visualisation) increased from 3% of new startups founded in 2019 to 28% in 2022 and 40% in 2023, driven by a number of factors ranging from the growing popularity of data products and self-serve data platforms, to powerful GenAI capabilities. While we acknowledge that Data Serving’s outsized contribution in 2023 is also due to a smaller base (with half as many data infrastructure startups founded in 2023 vs 2022, which is partly attributable to general slowdown in new startup formation in Europe in 2023), this category was the largest even as of 2022. As LLMs have made it possible to enable non-technical users to extract value from data through natural language, they have further underscored the need for shared definitions and a single source of truth across the organisation, leading to data modelling, semantic layers, metrics and “last mile transformation” solutions gaining traction – with more data serving tools building in these capabilities within their solutions.\n\n\n\nData Integration continues to attract founders, doubling from 10% of new startups founded in 2019 to 20% in 2023, with majority of startups focusing on data transformation and embedded integration. Data Storage has remained more or less consistent (13% in 2019 to 15% in 2023), though founders are increasingly focused on multi-model databases and supporting vector search, along with storage optimisation solutions (data compression, database gateway, database testing and so on).\n\nHow have funding trends evolved over the last five years?\nWe looked at total funding, as well as average and median funding round sizes for Seed and Series A raises. In 2023, both Seed and Series A median funding raises were below 2022 levels, at $3.6m and $12.8m respectively. However, the 10 largest deals within the space over 2019-23 were $10m+ at Seed and $25m+ at Series A. There is a wide dispersion even amongst the largest deals – for instance, document data extraction provider Rossum raised a $100m Series A round, and the second largest Series A deal during that period was data sharing provider Harbr at $38.5m. Given how large some of these outliers can be, our preference is to look at median deal values rather than average.\n\nTotal Seed round funding by year and category ($m)\n\n\nSource: MMC, Crunchbase\n\nAverage and median Seed funding ($m) by year\n\n\nSource: MMC, Crunchbase\n\nTotal Series A round funding by year and category ($m)\n\n\nSource: MMC, Crunchbase\n\nAverage and median Series A funding ($m) by year\n\n\nSource: MMC, Crunchbase\n\nAI everywhere\nIn The Metamodern Data Stack, we noted that AI is being used across every stage of the data lifecycle. Our analysis reveals that c.60% of data infrastructure companies in Europe & Israel leverage AI or offer AI-powered features in their products. We believe the numbers will increase meaningfully over the course of the year, as many data infrastructure founders we spoke to have plans of introducing AI-powered features.\n\nAI-powered companies as % of total, by type and overall\n\n\nSource: MMC\n\nNote: Data S&P stands for Data Security & Privacy, while Data M&G stands for Data Management & Governance\n\nWhat are data infrastructure startups using AI for anyway?\nWhile the popular belief is that everybody’s offering AI assistants/co-pilots, only 38% of Data Infrastructure startups currently provide this feature. Unsurprisingly, majority of AI Co-Pilots are used for code completion, and performing Text-to-SQL operations to enable non-technical users to ask questions about the data using plain English.\n\nAbout 31% offer AI-powered data transformation – automating data cleaning, validation, mapping and generating vector embeddings. We believe that data cleaning/validation/mapping represents the first level of AI-powered data transformation, and we’re excited about data integration that not only brings together different data types, but also the context and narrative underpinning them. For instance, looking at customer reviews (text) along with customer support calls (audio), product images (visual) to create a holistic view of customer experience.\n\n\n\n13% of startups leverage synthetic data generation – and this extends well beyond the typical synthetic data use case for training AI models, or data privacy startups creating synthetic data replacements for masking personal data (e.g. swapping out someone’s name from Peter Parker to John Doe). For instance, Dotphoton (an image data processing and compression startup) generates synthetic data to emulate different image acquisition modalities, such as variations in environmental and equipment settings, to optimise data processing for downstream AI systems. Or Snaplet uses AI-generated production-like data for seeding databases for local development and testing.\n\nThe use cases around using AI for sensitive data detection/redaction and automated documentation are fairly self-explanatory, but settings optimisation merit further explanation because they are so varied. For example, Onum uses AI to analyse how customers have historically used their analytics platform, what data they’ve used/not used in recent periods – all to optimise what data to collect and store. Data Security Platform provider Velotix uses AI to learn how to optimise data access controls without requiring end users to manually create data access rules, and Indexima uses AI to speed up queries for analytics purposes.\n\nCompanies leveraging a particular AI use case, as % of total AI-powered companies\n\n\nSource: MMC\n\nAlthough our discussion thus far has been on the practical use cases for which AI has been leveraged by data infrastructure startups, it’s also worth examining the intention behind these solutions, which broadly fall into 3 buckets: (1) hyper-automation; (2) dynamism; and (3) democratisation and scalability.\n\nHyper-automation: This includes a range of self-building data infrastructure tools. For instance, Integration.app’s AI system reads API documentation, converts it into a machine readable API specification, and then creates connectors based on the API specifications. Or Soax’s self-building AI-powered scrapers that require no coding and build themselves from plain English instructions (you just need to describe the data that needs extracting).\nDynamism: This helps the data infrastructure tooling evolve with the data that flows through the system. For example, data observability provider Sifflet’s AI solution helps to automatically modify data monitors in line with the changing data pipelines and shifting business patterns, as compared to traditional fine-tuning solutions that remain static.\nDemocratisation and scalability: This makes data accessible widely across an organisation. By empowering business users to extract value from data through natural language querying (and not inundating the data analytics team with requests), a variety of data serving tools from Fluent to Supersimple to PandasAI enable democratisation and scalability. Accompanying this greater democratisation is a heightened interest in granular access controls and data privacy.\nIf everyone becomes “AI-powered,” is it even a differentiator anymore? So what will be the differentiators?\n”AI-powered” is a term tossed around so frequently that it starts sounding like a marketing gimmick. That’s why through our previous research on The State of AI 2019, we uncovered that 40% of “AI” startups barely had any AI at all. However, in 2024 or a post-ChatGPT world, the dynamic is much more nuanced, where state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI models are easily available to everyone.\n\nBecause they are so easily available, they are becoming ubiquitous, which means that “AI-powered” as a label will cease to be a differentiator. Soon, it would be like announcing to the world (today) that you operate on the Internet or you offer a SaaS solution. Once this happens and the hype subsides, we expect a renewed focus on what outcomes the product achieves for its users, rather than AI for the sake of AI. That said, we already see startups like Baserow taking a user-led approach to introducing AI-powered features.\n\nSome data engineers that we spoke to were cautious about AI-powered data infrastructure products, because data pipelines are brittle, AI systems are brittle, and combining the two could lead to a catastrophic compounding of errors. Although AI Assistants/Co-Pilots as a use case sounds almost commonplace now (the rapid pace of AI development and proliferation of these solutions has made us jaded), this along with other “human-in-the-loop” approaches is currently preferable to higher levels of automation across the data lifecycle. This brings us to the true differentiators for AI-powered data infrastructure products (particularly as they aim for higher levels of automation and autonomy): accuracy, robustness, consistency, and reliability.\n\n\n\nWhat developments in the AI space could help or hurt data infrastructure businesses?\nWe believe data infrastructure founders should be actively looking into developments elsewhere in the Data/AI stack that could have a profound impact on their businesses. A vivid example of this is the way vector database provider Qdrant humorously introduced its product FastLLM, saying “Very soon, an LLM will come out with a context window so wide, it will completely eliminate any value a measly vector database can add. We know this. That’s why we trained our own LLM to obliterate the competition. Also, in case vector databases go under, at least we’ll have an LLM left!”\n\nBut it’s not just about the LLMs or AI models themselves, it’s also about the tooling and techniques around them. For instance, as AI model compression techniques (e.g. pruning, quantisation, distillation) improve and Edge AI models become more powerful, this would reduce the need for data transmission to centralised data centres. On the flipside, stream processing solutions such as Quix* would benefit from these developments as Edge AI requires high-quality real-time data.\n\n\n\nIn other developments, the burgeoning threat of AI-generated deepfakes has given rise to an entirely new breed of data authenticity solution providers, such as OpenOrigin, which create guarantees at the source that the data is of human origin (a different approach from Amazon’s text-to-image model Titan adding watermarks to prove an image is AI generated, and deepfake detectors like Reality Defender). Against this backdrop, AI-powered video anonymisation solutions like Pimloc are incorporating data provenance features (e.g. which pixels were changed in the video, when and by whom) given the rise of fake videos and the threat of manipulation. Going forward, we expect more data tools to build in data authenticity and provenance features. Given LLMs have increased the attack surface, we also expect data security and privacy to see significant tailwinds.\n\n\n\nWe could go on and on about the myriad ways in which developments in the AI space affect data infrastructure startups, but going back to our previous comment on what differentiates AI-powered data infrastructure solutions from each other (accuracy, robustness, consistency, and reliability), we believe it would be useful for founders to track recent developments in the Responsible AI space (on which we have written extensively) as these help you build more robust AI-powered solutions that provide reliable performance in production environments.\n\nDetailed Definitions\n\nData Collection\n\n01.\n\nData Integration\n\n02.\n\nData Storage\n\n03.\n\nData Serving\n\n04.\n\nData Security & Privacy\n\n05.\n\nData Management & Governance\n\n06.\n\nData Platform\n\n07.\nThe Metamorphosis into Metamodern\nData infrastructure is the unsung hero of the Age of AI. Not only does a robust data stack ensure the success of AI initiatives, the data stack itself is transformed by AI initiatives. We see many opportunities and challenges arising as this metamorphosis occurs, and if you’re a founder innovating in the data infrastructure space, please get in touch with Nitish or Advika – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMMC was the first early-stage investor in Europe to publish unique research on AI in 2017. We have since spent time understanding, mapping and investing in data infrastructure & AI companies across multiple sectors as AI has developed from frontier to the early mainstream and new techniques have emerged. This research-led approach has enabled us to build one of the largest AI portfolios in Europe.\n\n*Note: Ably, Blecon, MindsDB, Snowplow, Superlinked, Tyk and Quix are all MMC portfolio companies.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sadie Evans for her designs for the map, and especially her patience in putting up with our innumerable piecemeal changes!\n\nRelated Articles\nEnterprise AI\n\nESG compliance made effortless: Why we invested in Atlas Metrics\nWe’re thrilled to announce our latest investment: Atlas Metrics, a pioneering ESG data platform…...\n\nOliver Richards, Chirag Modi\n30.09.24\n\nNews\n\n\nEnterprise AI\n\nRobotics: What we look for in startups\nWe’ve previously discussed the exciting technological developments that are creating conducive conditions for robotics…...\n\nAdvika Jalan, Alex Reinert\n23.09.24\n\nResearch\n\n\nEnterprise AI\n\nRobotics: Featuring the transformers\nIn Part I of our series on Robotics, we explored the exciting technological developments…...\n\nAdvika Jalan, Alex Reinert\n16.09.24\n\nResearch\n\n\nEnterprise AI\n\nRobotics: What’s new, and why now?\nIf you’re being asked whether your height is between 5′ 7” and 5′ 11”,…...\n\nAdvika Jalan, Alex Reinert\n09.09.24\n\nResearch\n\n\n\nBack to Insights\nOur office\n24 High Holborn\nHolborn\nLondon\nWC1V 6AZ\n\n+44 (0) 207 938 2220\n\nUseful links\nNever miss out on news and events from MMC\nYour Email\n\n\n\nMMC Ltd is Authorised and Regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
