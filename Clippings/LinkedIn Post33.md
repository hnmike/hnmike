> Wanna learn something new about the Cloud today? ðŸ˜Š  
  
Stick around!  
  
Today, Iâ€™m sharing a bit about AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model).  
  
As the name suggests, AWS SAM is like CloudFormation but made for serverless applications. Think of it as Terraform, but AWS-native for serverless.  
  
With SAM, you define your infrastructure in a YAML file, no need to jump between services to create resources manually. Just write the config, deploy, and let AWS do the heavy lifting!  
  
Earlier this week, I worked with AWS SAM to build a simple setup:  
âœ… S3 to store files  
âœ… Lambda to process them  
âœ… API Gateway to expose the function  
âœ… DynamoDB for data storage  
  
Excited to dive deeper in the coming weeks!  
  
For my fellow Cloud enthusiasts, Have you worked with AWS SAM before?ðŸš€  
  
And if youâ€™re in a different field, what are you learning this week?ðŸ¤“  
Letâ€™s chat in the comments!  
  
Have a splendid day!
